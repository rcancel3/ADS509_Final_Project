Original review:
There used to be a button in the bottom right corner that eliminated the black bars at the top and bottom, clipped the video, and made it full screen. This is the optimal viewing experience for me and I’ve enjoyed it that way before the update and even on HBO Go before that. It’s gone now and I’m livid. Without this feature, you do not have the freedom to choose your best viewing experience. You have no choice at all now; instead, you pay to have HBO decide for you. HBO makes you suffer without this feature because they want to foster a “consistent viewing experience across all devices”. So I guess not being able to watch content the way you prefer doesn’t qualify as a good “experience” anymore. My experience is derived from the freedom to watch the content how I like it, so to remove that freedom seems counterintuitive, foolish, and nonsensical. My friends, our preferences shouldn’t be dictated by HBO. I yearn for the day our freedom will be restored in an update because, only then, will we have the truly optimal experience we used to expect from the Home Box Office.",2022-02-01 04:39:57,hbo-max-stream-tv-movies,971265422

Another complaint is that the episodes aren’t laid out, have to retype the title to see again what is next or reading the description. It’s just super slow and is nowhere near how amazing the Netflix app is built.  I hope it develops new downloads where it doesn’t create such a hassle trying to watch my shows and movies because it’s not worth $10 a month if all it’s gonna do is create problems and not allow me to watch movies on a smooth run. Also last thing, I hate how it’s so slow when I try to replay back. This goes the same for the website as well. Like Netflix has never given me this problem (I’m not complaining that Netflix is better but in comparison between app navigation, it is top tier) I like rewinding to watch best comical scenes and whatnot but Everytime I do on HBO I have to remind self to try and not do it or it crashes into this slow time warp.

I just rejoined, and the bad experience is making me think it will be a pay-for-a-month-and-out situation. Get your act together, HBO. Why throw all that money at making good content if your app dev team is going to chase away your subscribers? 

Update: the Developer response only addresses my “feature request” for full screen. That is a “feature restore” after some bizarrely-bad decision to remove it. I’m not going to go fill out some form to get it back - this should be obvious. 
Also, the app is objectively bad in many ways: slow, laggy, locks up randomly, crashes, poorly laid-out, odd controls, and so much more. No amount of feedback can help a team that would release such a bad app in the first place. They need to just look at other apps that work correctly, and do that.

I’m using an iPhone 12 Mini with the latest iOS and good internet, not sure if that makes a difference. Given how solid HBO/Warner’s selection of shows and movies is (now I’m talking content), I wouldn’t want folks to miss out or not try it on their phones because they think the app’s gonna crash regularly. Or maybe it will for you, who knows, but I’ve been using it almost entirely on mobile for over a year and have had zero issues.

Does nobody at HBO have a Netflix/Amazon/Disney/Hulu account?  Here’s a tip HBO, drop $18/month for the premium Netflix subscription and take it as a tax deduction for research and development of your own app.  HBO should just admit they’re inept and hire literally anybody with a half decent app to create theirs.  Please fix the browsing interface, add options to change brightness on the screen, improve the apps ability to download over cellular as 5G is now much faster than most home Wi-Fi and yet the app could not be more fickle in starting a download over cellular even when a speed test clocks the connection at 500+ mbps.

Some programming, such as VEEP, include actual parts of the show under the credits. The auto play in VEEP cuts off a full two minutes of the program. This is as much of an insult to the people who created this program (and many others who employ this technique) as it is for some idiot to pan and scan some directors carefully crafted film. Why do the intellectual property representatives even allow it?

HBO Max is not the only app guilty of this. BritBox does it too. The standard design of auto play should be ALWAYS to play the ENTIRE program. If there is a manual option, it should be too advance the auto play, not stop the auto play. This should be industry wide! HBO has always prided itself on extremely high-quality programming. With HBO Max, it has diluted its brand considerably.

And this archaic nonsense where I can’t turn off the auto play and I have to watch the first five seconds of the next episode before I’m able to turn it off, since it already takes so long to respond, is really irritating. Why can’t I just turn off auto play so it automatically goes back to browse when a show ends? Not everybody binge watches entire seasons of shows at once. I like to mentally digest an episode before I move onto the next one. But really I don’t need a reason. You need to give us more options. People are who they are.

No other app has had this issue when it comes to downloaded content. 

It is time for HBO max to make a new app design and provide a services update to fix the downloaded content issue. For the amount of money my family pays, I should be able to watch the movies and tv shows I downloaded, but sadly HBO max will not let me. 

Word of advice, if there’s a tv show or movie that you really enjoy I would suggest buying it off of iTunes and downloading it directly to your device.  I’m going to start doing that from now on.",2022-07-16 16:02:46,hbo-max-stream-tv-movies,971265422

Firstly, It seems like these guys have never heard of a share button. I’m watching a documentary on the phone and there’s no button share it. 

Secondly, when I went to resubscribe, I couldn't find the re subscribe option under ‘subscriptions’. Under that tab it redirects you to a ‘learn more’ page where you still couldn’t find the re subscribe option. Only when you try to play a video will it take you through renewal steps, so what should’ve have been 3 clicks, became 10. When have you heard of an app or any service making it difficult to resubscribe?

Third, I can’t find an option to alter the video quality at all. When you’re watching on mobile data, you might need to lower the quality to watch it. 

Fourth, I don’t see an option to rate or review the movie in the app, at least I can’t find it. Not sure why they wouldn’t want this data since it could enhance their recommendation engine. If they had a section under the title for adding ratings or reviews, it could increase engagement with users in the long term.  

In this day and age, these just seem like obvious features that a well capitalized company should be able to easily implement.

This app is so buggy it’s almost as if it’s a developers amateur app they’ve developed for coding boot camp or something. I’ve never even seen some of the bugs that occur in this app before. For example when I play an episode of a series, the app will lag for MINUTES, like 1-2 STRUGGLING just to start to play an episode. Sometimes it just never does, even though my internet is completely fine. But half the time after it does this the episode will magically think it’s been played and just skip into the next episode. Then I have to manually back out and try to open up the previous episode which the app now thinks I have already played. I can’t even fathom how such a bug would happen, but it’s the HBO Max app and it’s better at being buggy than being an app for playing actual content.",2022-07-28 02:49:32,hbo-max-stream-tv-movies,971265422

It’s not any better on any other platform, by the way. Pretty much the only place it’s tolerable to use HBO max is on a computer. Even then it’s a terrible experience.

Do you want to rewind a few seconds for a joke you maybe missed? Good luck, because rewinding causes the app to short-circuit and outright stop working.

Delivery of content gets a C-.  The app is slow and glitchy.  It often takes forever to load (connected to file Wi-Fi).  Often it just conks out an says “no connection” at the top even their there is clearly a mobile connection.  

MOST FRUSTRATING OF ALL is that you can download shows to watch while in transit, for example on a plane, BUT when you go to watch while in airplane mode the app will not open.  What good is a download if you cannot watch it while traveling?  The same feature work on platforms like Netflix—it’s amazing that a company as big as HBO with so much to invest (and to lose) would put out a half baked product.
