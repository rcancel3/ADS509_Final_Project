Wesley Brilhante,"Well explained I’ve been using all the topaz labs softwares but then I came across photo lab 5 and downloaded the free trial and I was blown away by all it’s features and the fact sorry I know it’s a video about comparing the Denoise from topaz and Deep Prime from photo lab 5 we can ignore the fact that with photo lab 5 you get noise reduction,you have features that do the same thing that the sharpen AI does as well all in one software only thing that you don’t have on photo lab 5 is gigapixel AI but it’s a tool that is not very often used so whatever I’m really thinking about getting DXO Lab 5 Pro and add to my collection of softwares I think that if you have the cash to spend and it’s very serious about photography you should have both,these are not toys are instruments of work that you can make that money back from your work,just make sure that you grab your camera at all times with you and keep shooting it’s when you less expecting that you can get some of the great pictures",2022-01-21 06:03:36,False,Great review thank you,5,youtube-watch-listen-stream,544007664
jman2595,"Update (October 1,2022): the issue with the older videos not showing up in the subscription tab was resolved but has started happening again. Also I have suggestions for videos marked for kids, I think the comments could and should be brought back for all videos if you put a system in place that prevents people from posting comments that includes explicit or offensive language. Also I think the penalty for marking a video incorrectly should change from a money fine to a timed bane from posting videos. Again I would love to make and upload videos but I have interest in making videos that could land in the grey area making it confusing on trying to figure out how to mark the videos and I can’t afford a money fine of really any big amounts. (Original review)In the subscriptions area the same 5 or 6 videos continue showing up in a loop as I scroll down what should be older videos I didn’t choose to hide don’t show up instead it’s those same 5 or 6 videos this needs to be fixed ASAP also it won’t allow me to hide videos anymore(as of 10:07 p.m. December 3,2020) Other than those issues it’s an enjoyable and sometimes useful platform to watch videos on, I would create videos myself but I’m to worried that I would label a video wrong and then potentially get fined thousands of dollars.",2022-10-02 03:40:33,False,Same videos keep showing up in loop and made for kids suggestions,4,youtube-watch-listen-stream,544007664
v87878787,"If the video goes into an ad then I lose my spot in the comments. Basically the app closes the comment section to make me focus on the ad. The ads have gotten ridiculous.

When appropriate I’m fine with the restricting of ads. When appropriate I’m fine with age restrictions. I’m sick of hearing about videos being taken down without a legitimate reason. See thunderfoot’s video debunking coronavirus conspiracies. I’m sick of creators being removed because you disagree with them. Unfortunately I’m not sure where to start with this as they just disappear. Speaking of videos not appropriate for ads - why do I get ads that are not appropriate for all ages? I get ads that are just rap videos with the “n” word and “f” bombs thrown around every few seconds. These “ads” are talking about drugs and drive by shootings. Why is that ok? Oh, and now I get constant ads for Umzu- a “supplement” company. Why is it ok to market unproven drug claims? Haven’t creators been punished for doing the same?

Wow - I just tried watching a movie on here for the first time. I turn the movie on and immediately get “ad in 5 seconds.” Literally 1 minute plays and I get another set of ads.

hgighjb,"Please stop the censorship. Let people communicate freely and decide for themselves what they think and feel. The internet has already become censored enough by the removal of comment sections and through rampant consolidation/mergers into monopolies or near-monopolies. Trying to direct comments into Twitter or Facebook forces people to join those sites which have become clearing houses for sale of people’s private information to companies and to massive profiling by the government. Both should be illegal.   These aren’t the principals that America is supposed to be about and it will ultimately be bad even for the businesses that behave this way. Look at what’s happened to Facebook. Same thing goes for the music industry and traditional radio stations.  Competition leads to innovation and improvement. Freedom of expression is essential to to our way of life, and censorship does not prevent people from understanding the truth. It just leads people to reject your business and destroys consumer confidence.  People know that censorship of this type isn’t for the public’s benefit or for small content creators - it’s to protect powerful figures and special interests and to make the general public feel alone when they disagree with a message, or when they’re being lied to.

Most videos I watch are short and I am inundated with ads.  There’s no enjoyment in that and then you must watch 2 lengthy commercials that you cannot skip through!  A 5-second commercial ad I can handle; any longer and I’m not even watching the ads, though I have to waste my energy doing something else until I can view the videos.  It becomes a mission to skip through the ads vs. watching a video.  Then I just move on even though that ad is waiting for my return!  There are ads that advertise products throughout browsing videos which catch my attention as they relate to my interests.  The commercial ads have never induced me to watch nor buy  what they are selling- ever - on TV, radio or elsewhere.  In the old days it was time for chores; now I can prerecord!  There must be a better way to determine length and amount of ads per length of video!

Also, just too many damned ads. Anytime I click ANYTHING there’s an ad. I watch a video, there’s an ad before and after. I click another video after the last ad, and it takes me to another, even longer ad and doesn’t even let me watch the video I clicked. This is in addition to the tracking that I know it’s doing on everything I do. Don’t get me wrong, there are still things YT does that you just can’t find anywhere else.

I doubt despite this drastic increase in ad amount/length that the creators are getting much more money. Also all of these terrible changes such as removing the dislike button are in no way supposed to benefit creators or the userbase. It is all used to support companies, yourself, and scammers. If it was really used to help small creators, they shouldn’t be able to see their own dislikes. Now more people are getting scammed by seeing videos with a ton of likes and no dislikes.

For me, and many others a big part of the experience is being able to look at comments and easily jump between other’s reactions and thoughts on the video, along with easily being able to jump between time stamps listed in the comments and the video. Now, it’s far too easy to overlook the comments altogether since they tend to blend in with the description or even get overlooked as part of an ad. It’s also ridiculously easy once you’ve clicked to look at replies to a comment to exit out of them completely since the X just closes them all instead of that specific comment, which makes it all supremely annoying to navigate. It would be good to give the option to toggle back to a “classic” view at least, since it isn’t only the comments, but also the recommended videos that are troublesome to look through as well.

Also, I’m not very impressed with the new location of comments on the iPad version. Originally, you could easily skim through comments on the left side of bottom while skim through recommended videos on the right side. With the new location, you will need to click unnecessary extra times to open the comments and then close it before you can get back to the recommended videos. Given the typical screen size of iPads, the whole left side of bottom has been wasted (and users end up wasting time clicking more times…). I could see why the comments moved on iPhones (because of smaller screens), but I find that such a same “adaption” on iPad is a total useless deadweight loss.

A Few Annoying Problems...
1年前
ME I SENT THIS!
I've been using this app for years and it has
been great. It works well and is a nice quality
app. I have a few problems though, and it has to
do with the subscription tab. The first problem
is that it will often say that someone has posted
(showing a little blue dot on their icon) but they
haven't. No big deal, but if I click it to make the
blue dot go away, then go back to a different
tab (such as the home) it will put the blue dot
back. That makes it so there is a red dot on the
subscription button which just bothers me. It
also usually happens to people with less that 1k
subs.
The second problem I have is that I don't get all
community posts. I am subscribed to a lot of
people, and a good amount of them make posts
regularly. Maybe this is supposed to happen,
but I don't get them all, and I would like to.
The last problem (which I find more funny) is
that when I click all to see everyone I am
subscribed to, it shows everyone as normal.
But, if I leave the app and come back, or slide
up on my phone (to show brightness or
flashlight) it will switch around the names so
that they do not match the right person.
Other than these three problems, the app is
amazing.

It also brings me a bit closer to the stars because I just learned something about them or that I heard their upmost struggle. It’s surreal. The interviews brings myself to dig into my own persona and make me want to do things a little different in my life, for the good.

cockslayer56,"when i first joined the platform around 2016, i saw some good quality stuff. but ever since 2019, the quality has been rapidly declining. first it was the recommended section going kinda crazy weird, then it was yt shots which is just a complete copy of other media, and then there was the removal of dislikes which i am still salty with.
i find the removal of dislikes COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY, as they help people know what to trust or whats good. also the factthat y’all   used “dislikes were hurting influencers mental health” is a joke because dislikes can help them see whats popular and also they can still see the like to dislike ratio in yt studo and anilitics. also just to mention, the removal of dislikes have also been affecting my recommend even more, especially the shorts. i keep getting terrible videos that i have no idea how they got into my recommend.  before that, it would make sense why a video was there.",2022-07-02 12:03:11,False,is this some kinda joke???,3,youtube-watch-listen-stream,544007664

Also, I hate that notifications from channels I’m subscribed to appear in two places. I get a notification from the “Subscriptions” tab AND the bell icon at the top of the screen. Why would I need two notifications for the exact same thing?

While I’m on a roll, I’d also suggest removing the upload button. I will not and completely refuse to watch shorts and that’s the only reason it’s there.

reddshift 97,There was a lot of talk on the more then one ad to me I get it there’s a chance that person left the videos going and plays through. But when someone is actually paying attention to the video they can just skip the ads all at once not even looking at the second ad. Now They’re deciding to do these ‘Double-Tap’ Ads which is frankly really annoying. Needing to wait 5 seconds to skip one ad only to watch another is not my main reason to skip the first. I know that companies exploit the ads by making them 5 seconds not being able to skip the ads is possible but just leave it like that. If any case I’ll end up with 2 ads running for 10 seconds and be done with it. Now I need to do double taps on them. Honestly if you’re going to play ads make them short because the main thing I want to watch is the video I clicked on not the ads.,2022-09-10 08:13:30,False,Double-Tap Ads????,1,youtube-watch-listen-stream,544007664

Senior Reviewer,There is a serious problem with this app. The problem is that an entire saved playlist that you make can disappear. It doesn’t matter what iOS version you have or what iphone model you have. It’s happened on all my iPhones over the years. It is something that’s been an issue for years. I do have several playlists like over 40 playlists so I don’t know if the issue only happens on people with several playlists or if it can also happen on someone with only a few playlists. But that’s something your IT department can look into and fix. It’s very annoying when your entire playlist that you made all of a sudden disappears and you can’t watch your saved videos or get it back. Also it can be more than one playlist that disappears at a time. Once you fix this bug I will rate 5 stars.,2022-01-18 18:30:16,False,Major Flaw with App!!!

These days, people cry out for equity, but you eliminate the conservatives.  I think that someday soon you will need to reconsider your operations, because Jesus Christ is going to be revealed to the earth in a huge way, and so you need to repent now while you still have time to. 

I say this with love.  A doctor has love for a patient when he tells him that he has cancer.  I am speaking love to you that your company has cancer as it silences Christians.  Change your thinking, and God will forgive and honor you.  Follow Him and you will experience peace and joy. ❤️

The Alexa,"The YT app is simply atrocious, not to mention I have to have the app to watch videos. YT doesn’t want me to watch them in-browser on my phone. 

This app wants me signed in. And it KEEPS signing me out (usually in my sleep). The google account I’ve always used to sign in (so it has all my saved vids and stuff) is linked to an old phone number, so YT tries to text that number. I will not update my phone with google/YouTube because there is no reason that an email app or a video watching app should need my number. 

When I get logged out of YT, the other way to verify it’s me is through my email. 

At this point, my Gmail app has typically logged me out, too. It makes no sense because it’s not from inactivity, as I use them most days. 

My password should be good enough to log me in. Multi factor authentication should be an options for those who want it, but I have nothing sensitive tied to this account, so its abhorrent that I’m required to update my phone number (every time I update it, I immediately get spam calls at all hours every day after).

Alecs N.,Videos will continue to play while the timeline is froze after some time of the audio and video continuing the video will freeze and the only way to get things running is to fast forward or rewind at which time the video will glitch out either to the where the timeline froze or start showing video is 10x speed and require the video to be closed and reopened before the video can be watched again,2022-05-18 14:33:09,False,Video player is broken,1,youtube-watch-listen-stream,544007664

yoshiikira,The only reason I am still on this app is because some of my favorite content creators are here. If it weren’t for them I would have deleted it after they added two consecutive ads and longer unskippable ads. It’s annoying having to sit through 1 minute and 30 seconds of ads for a 5-10 minute video. I hope one day someone makes a better app than this one.,2022-04-25 09:16:20,False,ADS ARE ANNOYING,2,youtube-watch-listen-stream,544007664
dooby the kid,"By one concern at this time, once you open your queue and see something you want to watch but there another thing you want to watch. You can only choose one or else you lose the entire clip after your viewing. Maybe I am doing something wrong.",2022-04-23 04:53:31,False,Wonderful,4,youtube-watch-listen-stream,544007664
Erionziu,"Take it easy on the ads Google ! I get it that it’s a free service that you make money from the ads …but if it becomes to annoying then we might stop using it . Same thing happened to MySpace . It became unusable. Ads are stopping you from watching a song . You just kill the mood with that . You used to have ads on the bottom of the screen…and that’s ok. But stopping a video , especially a music video to show a commercial…that’s a NO NO !!",2022-04-13 22:27:40,False,Easy on the ads !!!!,1,youtube-watch-listen-stream,544007664

George Beecher,"Revert the horrible change you made to how comments/description takes up half the screen in landscape. If I'm holding my phone in landscape, it's because I want to see the video larger. Obviously. 

Also, I thought Apple required companies to detail the changes made in an update, specifically because of sketchy companies like YouTube/Google? You NEVER say what you updated.",2022-02-12 06:07:17,False,Horrible landscape experience,2,youtube-watch-listen-stream,544007664
