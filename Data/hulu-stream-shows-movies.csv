I’ve just been wandering the streets of London looking for… something… anything… for about two months now. I eventually saved up enough money from guilt tripping strangers and bought a smart phone, hooding it could give me joy. I downloaded app after app, but the deep pit inside of me just grew deeper and deeper, each game and lifestyle app I downloaded seemed to trap a part of my soul inside. Then, as I stood on the precipice of oblivion, about to cast my new phone into the English Channel, I accidentally downloaded this app, and suddenly life just rushed back into me like a big ol’ speedball. Just weeks after getting this app, my life has changed monumentally. I have been knighted by the Queen, and I’m not even British! I’m from New Jersey. I’m also the second richest person in the U.K. now if that’s not enough to make you download this app, then you are truly lost for good. I hope my story will inspire others to download this app and have their lives changed like mine. I LOVE YOU!",5,"Magnificent, better than tinder",hulu-stream-shows-movies,376510438,
False,2022-09-12 16:11:39,belllllllllllllllllla,"When you turn your phone upright you see your show plus numerous options underneath you can press to watch another show.  This is great in theory, except it is extremely, extremely easy to accidentally hit on a new show when you don’t mean to.  So, I am constantly watching a show and my phone turns upright when I move and then I accidentally press on another show.  Then my show stops, it starts loading another show, I have to X out of it and start my show again.  I have numerous streaming platforms and this is the only one that has this issue. Part of the reason this happens is because the whole screen becomes a button to switch your show.  If you could put a smaller play button next to the show options instead of the whole area being the button, it wouldn’t as easy to accidentally start a new show.  It is frustrating to constantly have a new show start playing because you picked up your phone and your finger simply touches the screen!!!!!  When I am watching a TV show this usually happens 2-5 times per show.  Again, I have a lot of steaming apps and this is the only one I have a problem with but the other apps have a different layout that makes it harder to start a new show in the middle of another show.

False,2022-01-27 07:23:20,Havbebskdh1,"I’ve noticed some major flaws when casting shows using chrome cast. The episode listed “up next” usually doesn’t change when moving on to a new episode playing in the player. If I turn off my phone and turn it back on, the app shows it’s connected to the tv, but I don’t see a way to get back to the episode that is currently playing. The app also has issues with the episode list occasionally freezing or just disappearing after moving to the next episode. Please work on these bugs to make casting useable.

 Edit: casting over airplay is also pretty bad. There is a ton of lag when trying to use any of the video controls. I’ve discovered the only way to use the skip 10 seconds button is to do it from an Apple Watch. For some reason the episode up next does actually change most of the time when using airplay. Maybe ask the developers over at Netflix,  for some tips on how to make your casting better. Other than the casting having major issues the app is pretty good, I haven’t had problems watching on a device.

Edit: the episode list bug was finally fixed but while casting the app has problems with playing a whole segment of commercials twice. It’s really annoying to get to the end of the commercial break and then have them all repeat again.",2,Good but casting is flawed,hulu-stream-shows-movies,376510438,

I guess the developers think this will hook you in to the other show. Instead it makes me so want to never watch that other show. Ever. Also, they really should rethink idiotic series like “Maggie” which really diminishes Hulu’s credibility. The ads for that show boil my kidneys, especially in their tokenizing of Black people and Gay men in one handy-dandy, completely offensive and unlikely character whose only function is to propel the inane narrative of the most boring protagonist in the history of Rom Coms forward. No self respecting gay, Black man would be fawning over such a bland white chick.

The main problem is that it will lose its place where it was in the episode and makes you start over. When you go to fast forward to where you were, you have to watch the beginning of show commercials, AND the commercials right before the spot you’re locating. I’ve also had it randomly change what show or movie I was watching but since it makes me watch commercials first, I don’t realize it until afterwords. Basically I just watched 6 minutes of commercials before being able to find the spot I was previously watching on my phone.

One, the ad timer is now a lie.  Ads timers are now never less than two minutes.  And when that timer runs out, the ads keep going.  Up to six minutes+ at times.  And that is just one ad break.  Really if I could find some of this stuff on sat or cable I would have to deal with less ads that way.

Two, the ad timers are hard breaks fixed in the show.  If the transition messes up from ad to show, and the show timer progresses while not displaying the show because it hung up at the end of an ad?  If you try to rewind to see what you missed, well get ready for another four minute+ ad break because you rewound into the break.

Three, the transition messes up at times, either delaying giving you the show, but the play timer is progressing and dumps you into the show at the point the hang up finally resolves.  Or it resets the show to the start.

Four, you can’t even effectively fast forward in case of a restart.  Because the app will force you to watch each break you fast forward over trying to get back to where you are.  Hit two or three, and you can run out to pick up dinner and still get back in time.

Sometimes it’s the commercials that have no audio, sometimes it’s the show/movie, and sometimes it ends up being both. This is exclusively an issue with AV receivers and Soundbars using HDMI ARC/eARC. This is the ONLY app on Apple TV that has this issue, presumably becuase it’s the only app that jumps back and forth between audio layouts/codecs (commercials vs content) 

The only fix is to switch the audio language (if there’s even another option) and then switch it back, OR go back to the menu and click watch again. But you have to do this almost EVERY TIME after a commercial break.

I’ve tested this on 4 different setups and they all have the issue except for when there’s no external audio device.
