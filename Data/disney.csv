3,False,MISSING many shows (and languages),2022-01-19 09:47:47,"I grew up watching many a Disney shows. Signed up for Disney, most of them are not available. The ones that are, not available in my language (or a decent selection at all.. Ebglish and Spanish only, really?)There are official dubs that were aired on public television DECADES ago already, and Disney+ only has English for most of the shows IF they are even on there to watch. At least they finally have the Clone Wars (magnificent animation as always Tartakovsky is magnificent) but I had to wait for that as well. The app will crash/freeze if you hit the rewind button too often (not for people that like watching specific scenes again and again), and there is no option to either loop a video (Yes, I would like to have Biomes and Vehicle on in the background while I work/sleep), or to make it stop asking ‚Äúare you still there‚Äù so at some point it will stop playing and if you have loud neighbors throwing on Dinsney+ to tune them out whilst you sleep is not an option. The quality of the videos themselves is top notch though, (volume could be louder, but visuals are GREAT). But, seriously, why own the rights to all these shows and not let people see them or make them available anywhere else? I want my nostalgic throwback to before. 3 STARS: because they‚Äôre sitting on the content they own, and deriving people of content that used to be readily available decades ago (used to be with basic cable for free, and now you get to pay and not see them)",Beschissenen Nicknames,disney,1446075923
1,False,really quite upset,2022-07-08 12:40:58,"pretty sure this was deliberate. my old iphone6 is basically dead. unfortunately it was the phone i was using when i signed up for disney+. now i need to change the email attached to the account and i cant do that unless they email me a passcode. the customer service person sent the passcode, rejected error 21. they sent another one. no good. so they sent another one except it was the same as the first. this was of course AFTER they logged out all of my devices so i am now UNABLE TO USE THE SERVICE I HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR! this is only a couple of months after i had to argue with them for hours to reset the password after a previous involuntary logout disney did to us that ended up with a like 50 character password i had to draw out on graphing paper cause my handwriting is garbage since i started typing everything which isnt here or there. but what is pertinent is im like 99% sure theyre doing this because my voice is horribly deep so they know im trans. theyre already working on exterminating us and now i have nothing to watch while i wait for the new american fascism to put us all into camps. 
honestly, did not care about cutting netflix when they decided to stand up for transphobic comedians. have no problem responding to warner bros. insistance on supporting jk by cancelling hbomax. now disney-who granted seem to want to ignore our existence completely- im losing my superheros and im sincerely depressed by it. whatever goodbye disney.",nada pseudonym,disney,1446075923
3,False,Probably the worst streaming app.,2022-04-04 17:36:47,"We have just about every streaming app you can think of, and as much as I want this one to be my favorite, it's definitely the worst and the most unreliable. We use Disney+ every single day since we have Little's that NEED to watch Encanto on a constant loop, however myself and my husband are huge Marvel fans so we use it just as much as the kids do. 

My kids lost the remote to our TV last week, and I have stripped this house bare trying to find it and can't. So we have been relying on screen mirroring and casting. Disney+ is the only app that we have that refuses to work. 

When we did have our TV remote and could use Disney+ it would ALWAYS (about every 30 minutes) kick us out and tell us our internet was working. So we would just exit the app and go back in and it would be fine. We just moved into a new home and I was hoping the connection with the app would be better. Nope. It still times out about every 30 minutes and tells us there no internet connection when everything else in our house is working just fine. Basically when this happens you would have to exit the app, then return and if MIGHT start to work. The only reason I haven't deleted this app already is because my daughter HAS to watch Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.",semi-stayathomemom,disney,1446075923

But I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the app or my tv or my phone because I‚Äôm getting frustrated because I wanted to watch tangled with my family but the controller ran out of battery. And it was about 10:28 at the time and if we went to the store at that time it would be closed the time we got there so we had to just use it threw our phones. First my sister tried, it didn‚Äôt work. Then I tried, it also didn‚Äôt work 
At this point I was getting a little frustrated because there was no other app that had tangled on there so we tried 1 more time but it didn‚Äôt work we used the connect to tv button also multiple times it said we had to fix something in settings so we went to settings and we couldn‚Äôt find anything Related to Disney usually it would take us straight to where we need to go and what to do but no nothing worked so Disney please fix this problem but other than that the app is amazing it is perfect for kids and Disney lovers it has all the Disney movies created and there is not 1 movie you can‚Äôt think of that‚Äôs not there.

2,False,Frequently causes issues with connectivity,2022-02-18 00:45:59,"App works great through non-iOS devices but locks up about every 20-40 minutes on iPhone or iPad. Not just the app itself, but most other apps lose connection to their servers as a result despite that several speed tests show the device is still well connected to WAN. Doesn‚Äôt happen with any other apps and is consistent across multiple devices. I‚Äôd suggest the devs look into how Disney+ handles data traffic on iOS because having to turn WiFi off and on several times an hour is simply aggravating. 
    Also, regardless of connectivity‚Ä¶ it would be an absolutely smashing idea to make it easier to access the main menu for recently-watched series (I.e. the page that lets you select seasons and browse episodes). I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs either an oversight or perhaps too difficult to implement basic infrastructure changes, but so far, users only have the option to restart the last series episode from the home page and exiting with the ‚Äú<‚Äú option at top left just brings you back to home. Wouldn‚Äôt it be especially nice to not have to click through multiple menus to find the series you were watching (for me it may have been seconds ago) every single time you use the app (aka what customers should and do expect)?",tritip fairy,disney,1446075923

1,False,"amazing, but‚Ä¶",2022-07-30 04:36:37,"Disney + is a magical app, beautiful, truly. The only reason I‚Äôm giving it a one star is, pretty unreasonable but, I‚Äôm an unreadable person. Anastasia, yes the Russian princess that got turned into a movie, it‚Äôs amazing, ( watch it sometime if you haven‚Äôt already, or rewatch it. ) It used to be on Disney +, but they did something‚Ä¶ unimaginable, they took it off the app. I don‚Äôt understand why if I‚Äôm being honest, it‚Äôs a movie that has characteristics hard to find, for example : character, plot, romance, and so much more. I remember, I was doing a thing I do every once in a while ( like every 3-4 weeks ) and that‚Äôs watching can you guess?? Hint : it‚Äôs Anastasia. When I saw it was off Disney + I had to scavenge for a way to watch it, it‚Äôs not easy, I had to buy it. It‚Äôs a pretty old Disney movie, I know you wanna keep it fresh, whatever I‚Äôm fine with that, but this, this is good, it‚Äôs historical and something every child should know, so, putting it back on Disney + would be just amazing, children, teens, even adults can be scrolling through Disney + and see it and maybe think to themselves, ‚Äú hm, what‚Äôs this??? It looks entertaining, let me watch it! ‚Äú it‚Äôll spread around, be popular, I know I‚Äôll watch it. So please, I‚Äôm sorry for the star‚Äôs, it‚Äôs unreasonable, but I‚Äôm desperate.

I went to the settings, casting was turned on. i deleted the app, then reinstalled, same thing. I‚Äôve reset my phone, same notification. This started months ago and I cannot even see the devices i could cast to (i.e. tv, fire stick, etc). No other streaming app has this problem. I can cast from my phone to any device on every other streaming app, but a few months back, disney stopped allowing me to cast and nothing will change it. It is beyond frustrating but such a minor problem has made it impossible to watch movies with my family for MONTHS. Before, i was able to cast without signing into the app on the tv, but since i can‚Äôt cast from my phone, we have not been able to watch things on the tv. i‚Äôve updated the app 3 times since this problem started and nothing has changed. please fix this in the next update",kelseylanemartin,disney,1446075923

4,False,Great App,2022-08-05 22:03:13,"This is a great app with a lot of enjoyable content. However, I use the audio description feature and several movies, that have the description track available on iTunes do not have it available on Disney+. These include several of the Xmen movies such as First class, Days of Future Past,  Logan and the Deadpool series. It is quite frustrating that you can get audio description if you purchase these movies on iTunes but not if you stream them on Disney+. It costs a lot of money to purchase these movies, just to be able to watch them in an accessible format for the blind and visually impaired.  Given that these tracks have already been created for other platforms, it would be very much appreciated if they could be added to Disney+ just as the audio tracks for other languages have. I thank anyone who considers this feedback, as well as anyone who can work to implement it. I also appreciate Disney's ongoing commitment to accessibility.",Dryatofa,disney,1446075923

But this app does need a few things. First of all, you need to have more than two languages. I think you should have 5-6 languages on here. I‚Äôm saying this because some people speak different languages in the US. Secondly, you should have old Disney shows that people grew up watching. I‚Äôm also saying this because some like to adults like to watch old tv shows and movies. Lastly, if reading this review right now make sure you know Fox is another company that owns Disney.

The warning labels regarding culture were annoying but I was happy they were willing to put the content up anyway. Chalk that up to market forces! Some of the newer content was good, too. But within 6 months of starting my subscription I noticed the level of content that was pushing climate change, LGBTQEtc and other agendas was too much to take, and it was just starting to ramp up. It‚Äôs not Disney‚Äôs job to indoctrinate kids and sleepy adults like this. I canceled my Disney+ subscription as a result.

3,False,App needs work,2022-09-15 06:41:36,"The content is fantastic, but the app itself needs work.

For example, you cannot turn subtitles off permanently. It *always* defaults to having subtitles on. Lately, it always has them on in Chinese. I don‚Äôt know a lick of Chinese, so I‚Äôve no idea why it does this.

The app is also a bit buggy. My phone doesn‚Äôt remain connected to the app, and I keep having to reconnect in order to pause or change streaming volume, etcetera. Many times I need to close the app on my phone and reopen it, and then reconnect to whatever device I‚Äôm streaming on.

Playback is generally flawless, and the content is great. I wish it was easier to navigate and find what you want, but that‚Äôs what the search feature is for, I suppose.

Would be nice to have a rating system, or some way to curate content per person more easily. A dedicated banner for The Simpsons would be nice, too. With the massive amount of content there, having a dedicated button for them would be nice.

All in all, the app functions decently, but not as well as it should. 3 stars, because there‚Äôs zero reason why Disney can‚Äôt make this app flawless.

So whenever I dont use it for a long time, it automatically logs me out of my account. So, for me to want to watch a movie I like, I have to log back in to see it.

4,False,A note on Disney+,2022-06-22 16:30:45,"I appreciate the content that is produced and regularly released on the site, but find the site to be more difficult to navigate than other comparable services. 
My biggest complaint with Disney+ is that I can not find a feature that allows me to remove items from my ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù list if I do not wish to continue watching. 
If it is a movie, I have to scroll to the end in order for it to go away and if it is a show, it will be replaced on the ‚Äúcontinue watching‚Äù list by the next episode.
Disney+ should allow people to manage this list and remove items so that it better reflects what users want to watch and allows them to get better use out of it.",LI dad,disney,1446075923

I‚Äôve had this happen with 3 different shows and every time it gives you the lead up to something big and than there are just no more episodes to show what‚Äôs supposed to happen next so everything is also a cliff hanger that they just aren‚Äôt going to continue.

1,False,Worst media player ever,2022-04-27 10:25:17,"We all hate the mouse.  This isn't about that.  This app has, genuinely, the worst media playback decice I've ever had the displeasure of using.  My non-exhaustive list of observed faults starts with:  When opening the app while playing media using Picture in Picture, the app crashes and refreshes, stopping the media that's already playing.  
The player stores less than 10 seconds of content in advance.  If an internet connection is lost, media almost immediately halts, and additionally, using the 10-second navigation buttons take multiple seconds to download the new content.  It is extremely clunky.
The top half of the fullscreen player is far too sensitive to the ""back button"".  Occasionally, while attempting to pause media, or click on empty space to dismiss the media controls, the back button will activate inappropriately.
The playback controls are unresponsive.  Often, tapping the button does not activate immediately, having instead a fraction of a second of delay.

I would not recommend this app, regardless of the content displayed.  It is poorly designed, neglected, and not worth the money it'll charge you to watch media you've already seen",PitaSureWould,disney,1446075923

1,False,Seriously,2022-04-14 15:45:39,"I don‚Äôt keep my iPad perfectly up to date except for security concerns because every update kills 2 things I like and adds 3 things that tick me off. 

Now while every other of my 5 streaming apps still work despite predating Disney+ save 1, I now must update my iPad to update Disney+ to use it at all even though I updated my iPad ~6 months ago. 

Catch is my  ipad is now which barely predates our last president is updated to the max Apple will allow. 

So while I have 5 streaming apps that still work without issue Disney+ alone is is artificially defunct and is in de facto league with Apple to force premature hardware updates.

Extra annoying because Disney+ is the most likely to be used for kids and thus the most likely to be using the oldest tablets. 

Also of note Disney plus is demanding far more updates than other streaming services and outpacing other streaming services 2-3x in updates even though most of these updates are technically trivial or purely nonfunctional. 

I am canceling my Disney+ over this. Despite this not being the only hassle unique to this streaming app it is definitely the anvil that breaks the camels back for me.",refuserefuse,disney,1446075923

3,False,Terrible interface with Apple TV,2022-06-30 13:05:25,"I love using this app, but it‚Äôs really frustrating to use with an Apple TV, if you want to cast from the phone to the TV.

For one thing, every single time without fail that I switch it from my phone to the Apple TV, it switches the language to German. It will be playing in English on my phone, but then as soon as I cast it everybody is talking in German. This doesn‚Äôt happen with anything else that I cast to the Apple TV.

The app also becomes really unresponsive when casting. If you press anything it takes about 5 seconds to register, so if you have to do anything other than just let it play, like pause or change the language, you pretty much have to stop casting to do it.

Also, if you pause it long enough for it to stop casting, the Disney + app becomes totally unable to resume the show and I have to kill the app and start over. This wouldn‚Äôt be as big of a deal, except that it doesn‚Äôt remember your spot at all, so you have to restart the movie or show and find your place again.",Jajajajakaja,disney,1446075923

That excited and trust has been very short lived. I miss the days of clean conservative family friendly shows and movies. Now there are adult ratings, innaprostriate relationships in kid shows, and the adults are always the character ‚Äúidiots‚Äù while the kids know all.

No thank you. We have been paying for the year subscription and we will not be renewing our account again. I guess it‚Äôs back to dvds where we don‚Äôt have to worry about the kids have access to adult rated shows or prime where we can buy the ones that are kid friendly for them to have access to.

Unfortunately now I have to preview most newer content due to Disney pushing LGBQ and trying to slyly shove it down the kids throats. Highly doubt this was the vision Walt had when he created Disney but to each their own. Still has some really good content though (older content).  Maybe will cancel subscription maybe won‚Äôt. Will just see if newer stuff continues to trend the way it has. App performance has greatly improved since we first got Disney+ when it launched.

Moana is also rated PG, contains magic and fighting against monsters, but it is not available on a kids profile.

1. Signing into my account on the Disney app on the smart tv via my phone does not work.

But since the tv app keeps sending requests that completely denies me from logging in.

2. Casting via phone app to tv app works for 10 seconds at most and then the tv just goes blur, maybe encoding issues? I don‚Äôt know.

Why Disney nor apple have addressed this 4 years later is beyond ridiculous. Pretty diverse content and the interface is decent. Could use more customization options for picture quality. GUI needs updating to make content easier to find too. The poor video quality insists on a 0-1 star rating though.,AngryJonJon,disney,1446075923

1,False,Catch 22,2022-08-27 19:35:24,I have an older iPad. And I can‚Äôt afford to spend $800 on a new one. Apple cut it off from the iOS 14 update. My Disney+ app says it needs to update to run. So I click update. Store says I need iOS 14 to run new updated app so I must download an older version. Which is the version I already have. The version that says I need to update it in the App Store. It effectively eliminates Disney+ for me and I might as well just cancel the service then. Or you could just patch your older versions to not brick it until I update it. Just a thought. Just let me run the older version on an older device.,Mustbethursday,disney,1446075923
