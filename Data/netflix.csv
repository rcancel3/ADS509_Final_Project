Its amazing but needs to be better,False,Ruepuppy,I‚Äôve been using Netflix for 5 years and now I'm older i want to ask 1. Add a pre-teen and teenager setting where the shows for kids in kindergarten aren‚Äôt there and the setting should have barely any gore no nudity drugs or substance abuse and no adult content. It should have a survey that the teens/ preteens can find stuff they like to watch. 2.the ratings When Netflix rates stuff they barely look at it they just slap a rating on it. And thats not good considering some shows don‚Äôt even QUALIFY for the ratings they have. Like Bunk‚Äôd it has fear sure but its not as if it‚Äôs always there and it‚Äôs annoying seeing it pop up and its not even true like 75% of the time. 3.getting rid of good shows and keeping bad ones. The shows can be awful but stay on Netflix and the good ones get deleted off of Netflix. Like some animes like there‚Äôs god awful ones that almost no one likes but still stay on the platform but then shows that are great get deleted I don‚Äôt understand it. And 4. Seasons for shows. So if go to anywhere else and watch shows like bunk‚Äôd Henry danger or miraculous lady bug it has all the episodes of them cause they are finished while on Netflix its like 2-3 seasons on the show and its been like this for like 2 almost 3 years now and it‚Äôs bad because henry danger is actually over and missing 2 seasons and miraculous is missing a season so please fix it. But over this a great app,4,2022-07-25 19:15:23,netflix,363590051
Trash,False,ApatheticDread999,"I use a VPN to protect my privacy and the app always throws a fit about it because it will block me out of being to watch anything, even though the VPN has my location set to the same state i am in. ALSO whenever i try to watch something it has a habit of trying to connect to the TV. i didn‚Äôt change anything in the settings, i dont use my phone to cast to the TV because the TV itself is wonky, it didn‚Äôt ask me if i wanted to, i didn‚Äôt tap anywhere near the cast icon, but it does it anyways, all while my sister is trying to watch a movie with a friend in the other room. In other words, I cant watch my show without turning the wifi off because it would disturb others in the household and i cant do anything to fix it. This is a garbage app run by a company that thinks its okay to purchase the rights to JoJos bizarre adventure and stop the fans from enjoying the show like we always have, like we always do with every other anime. which is weekly updates. Noooo these losers want to force us to wait a year for a set of 12 episodes that you know we‚Äôre gonna blaze through because we are starved for the story, if you ever binge watched a show you know your mind doesn‚Äôt retain very much compared to watching an episode a week. Where you can immediately hop online after watching it and have so much to talk about with fellow fans on just that one episode, and with each episode the hype builds up and you get more excited for the episode to be released the following week.",1,2022-09-12 06:31:26,netflix,363590051
IDEA FROM A CONSUMER/VIEWER.,False,AwesoMapes,"I was scrolling through Netflix and I had a wonderful thought so I decided to act on it and write to Netflix through this review. There are plenty of times when I‚Äôm scrolling through Netflix and I am trying to avoid nudity in shows and movies. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if there were a way to toggle on and off all shows that have a specific tag instead of just the rating? For example, there are plenty of shows that are rated TV-MA and don‚Äôt have nudity that are great to watch. However, you have to filter them all yourself and check the rating before hand and it takes up a lot of time when looking for something new to view. Now, imagine if I can just go to me settings page and toggle on and off certain tags to make my browsing easier by removing shows/movies with the tag from appearing during your browsing. Now I know that doing it with every single tag would be a pain in the behind but just doing the major tags would help out a lot of people I think.

I also, want to explain what I mean by tag in the case it isn‚Äôt clear. I‚Äôm not talking about genre such as thriller, action. Etc. I‚Äôm talking about the tags associated with the rating system like nudity, extreme violence, adult content, adult language, etc.",4,2022-03-13 15:55:06,netflix,363590051
Still ad-free and affordable,False,cmm472,"I have subscribed to Netflix for years, left for a while and recently returned. I have seen quite a few good series over the years (The Last Dance, The Queen‚Äôs Gambit, and others). Downton Abbey is available to stream, and I‚Äôm happy to see that there is going to be another season of Atypical. Of all the streaming services that I‚Äôve tried, they have the best mix of programming. The app is well organized on my streaming player. The recommendation algorithm is getting better, and there is a large library to search. I wanted to add that personally I‚Äôm glad they are cracking down on password sharing.  I‚Äôve never thought it was fair that the honest subscribers were absorbing the cost for those who thought it was okay to take advantage. I am referring to people who share passwords with friends and family residing in other households.  Also, it‚Äôs interesting that the people complaining the loudest regarding ‚ÄúCuties‚Äù and the ‚Äúwoke agenda‚Äù are the ones who seem to be watching these shows.  I never knew those things existed on Netflix until they were pointed out because there is so much other programming to watch.  If you don‚Äôt like it, skip it and move on.",4,2022-04-24 14:48:14,netflix,363590051
Teens account,False,A_J_C11,"Hi Netflix and anyone reading this!
I think Netflix should have a teens account. For me personally I‚Äôm only allowed to have a kids account and I‚Äôm sure many people can relate. To be honest some things on the kids account are good movies. But for people 10 and older that need to have a kids account need a higher selection‚Ä¶sometimes I can watch the grown up account with parent supervision but I would rather just have a my own account. Right now I barley use my kids account and watch the grown up account but some parents don‚Äôt feel comfortable. Their kid can hide their phone and could be watching  weird inappropriate things. On the grownups account most things are rated R but some things don‚Äôt need to be on there like Stranger Things  and other shows etc. But on a kids account there are things for babies or little kids like Cocomelon. There is a grown up and a kid but their needs to be an in between. I don‚Äôt understand why Tall Girl is on the kids account. If someone who watches coco melon watches Tall  Girl  they will see boyfriends and girlfriends that 2 year olds shouldn‚Äôt see. Anyway, I think their should be a teens account. 
Thank you for your time.",4,2022-05-05 00:44:22,netflix,363590051

Some problems I would like to talk about no hate,False,IfYou're555ThenI'm666,"I used to have Netflix but now I unsubscribed and uninstalled and I would like to give some feedback why. 
First of all, Netflix price started getting really expensive and I think it‚Äôs kind of outrageous. Second of all, I feel like there should be teen section where it is not like for kids to watch and nothing too much going on like way too much gore, blood, yet no nudity and sexual content but kissing is fine and not way too much strong language and stuff like that. Because I‚Äôm not into kids stuff nor nothing way too adult going on (I can handle gore btw), I think it would be better because some teens don‚Äôt like watching stuff for kids nor nothing way too inappropriate for teens to watch.
Another reason why is that the movies and shows is being cancelled and now you can‚Äôt complete like the whole series or episodes or whatever.
I don‚Äôt know why Netflix have to be expensive it could be better at the lowest $5 and the premium where you watch bonus content, uncut version of movies or more exclusive features like no advertisements at $12. That be more fair for me in my opinion and I‚Äôm just disappointed how Netflix is now. But few years back I used to enjoy it a lot.",2,2022-02-12 18:04:07,netflix,363590051
NETFLIX PLEASE LOOK AT THIS AND EVERYONE PLEASE READ THIS,False,Truth4‚Ç¨v@r,"People who like to look at the ratings please look at this! Ima start with the positive side of this app and then move to why I hate it. Netflix entertains me a lot! I am glad it has a variety of shows to watch! But I love this anime called Demon Slayer and Netflix doesn‚Äôt even like to put the other seasons, it‚Äôs just like other shows, they don‚Äôt keep most updated. The only ones they keep updated are Stranger Things and adult shows. Out of all the entertainment apps I think this one is the worst! Netflix pls update Demon Slayer. I want to know what happens, and Netflix haven‚Äôt updated it ever since Netflix put it on the app. I want everyone to read this is also the company that owns Netflix. I am tired of Netflix not caring about the people who love their shows and don‚Äôt update them. Honestly I think this is why people aren‚Äôt using Netflix that often. Thank you for your time. Please Netflix update the shows you have for us. I love this app, it‚Äôs just that I have nothing to do and all I watch is demon slayer, but now that I don‚Äôt have it updated and can‚Äôt get any other apps I am frustrated.

App works but has bugs,False,justnobodyreally,"The app works but without exaggerating, I run into bugs almost every time I use the app. This is because my most frequent interactions (pausing and rewinding) for watching stuff HAVE BUGS. (1) Pausing and resuming video will make upcoming subtitles skip. So I need to rewind to catch the subtitles. Which brings up (2) rewinding more than once will cause video to freeze so I need to close and reopen the show (this gets annoying when it‚Äôs near the end of an episode so it opens the next one instead). And I need to rewind more than once very often because of the first bug. An example of this scenario is if I pause video and resume. Then it shows the current subtitle, but then the subtitle after is skipped. So I need to rewind back twice, which causes the video to freeze. I really feel like Netflix should have fixed pausing and rewinding video correctly by now since these are basic parts of playing video. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating to get hit with 2 back to back bugs very frequently, especially if it causes you to miss part of the end of an episode and closing/reopening the frozen video makes you start off in the next episode.",2,2022-02-08 11:19:14,netflix,363590051
What‚Äôs going on?,False,ace20201,"I LOVE Netflix, but the things they have been doing lately.... I don't quite understand. First, taking off a lot of the good movies/tv shows. A lot of people including myself, have a subscription to Netflix because of the content that's on their platform. But here lately a bunch of the content that us users subscribe to see is being taken of the platform. Those movies/tv shows includes The Vampire Diaries, Criminal Minds, Halloween, The Conjuring, and much more. I don't understand why Netflix is doing this, because the content on the platform is one of the main reasons people are even subscribing to Netflix. Next, bringing ads to Netflix. I have heard rumors about Netflix bringing ads to their platform in early 2023, but never expected it to actually happen. Being one of the very little number of platforms that are ad free is an additional reason that Netflix is so popular. A lot of people like ad free services where they don't get interruptions in the middle of a good tv show and/or movie. I don't understand bringing ads to Netflix because feel that this would be bad for company revenue.

Update: I changed the rating cause you put Criminal Minds back on then took it off again.",1,2022-08-27 03:53:38,netflix,363590051
Netflix pick up your game,False,netflix is mid now :(,"So lately this might just be me but Netflix will stop playing my show and give me the circle of annoyance. It has also been getting rid of a lot of good shows. I know this was a few years ago and I know where it is now but why did you get rid of clone wars (a show loved by all) before Disney+ was even talked about being made. There is a ton of other shows too. Like why have the Naruto shippuden movies but not the show, I mean you have shonen jumps. Another thing is during my episodes the audio will completely cut, I can still see things but not hear them and I have to restart the app. Also why can‚Äôt you make a teen option as other people have stated so that people can watch like pg-13 without all the tv-ma stuff so that people can watch shows on there own account. And about the audio cut thing, I have called customer support before about the audio and they said I‚Äôm a liar and that I‚Äôm the only one with this issue (which is not true it happens to other people I know) honestly Netflix your lucky this is my favorite platform or it would have a 1 star.

this app changed my life.,False,Zandog loves dole whips,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I‚Äôm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don‚Äôt smoke, but I occasionally drink. I‚Äôm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I‚Äôm trying to explain that I‚Äôm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life.

The summaries,False,SjageDaMae,"Some titles have summaries that just say who is in the movie and who directed it.

It doesn‚Äôt make sense to have a movie summary say ‚ÄúLeading Actor/Actress is an award nominee who teamed with award winning film director‚Äù that has nothing to do with the premise of the story and it‚Äôs annoying to see a movie and not know what it‚Äôs about, especially since these particular ones usually have trailers that tell very little. Again they‚Äôre basically teaser trailers that just show who‚Äôs in it and what film festival said about it. Even the great Martin Scorsese has directed a dud film or two. Please just tell me what it‚Äôs about rather than telling me the cast. There‚Äôs already a section where people can see who helped work on the project. It would be nice to keep them separate because when I‚Äôm trying to find something to watch I want to know what I‚Äôm watching, not who.

Netflix,False,cloey evans,It‚Äôs great but I honestly think there should be a teenage section I would help because I search for hours and can‚Äôt find anything in My age group. I personally like romantic movies and films and it upsets me that half of them are grownup ones I honestly don‚Äôt mind that but there should be more teenage love. I also think there should be more pride movies you have a lot of romantic movies with straight people I feel like there should be more because there love matters just as much and they have good meanings to them and teach a lesson. Recently I watched a movie called hidden kisses and it should get lesson out there because hating on your own child for making there own Decisions it can affect them more then you know one person judging them could make them want to end there life.

"Great, but some bugs.",False,A BLACKPINK Fanüñ§üíñü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,"So when I‚Äôm in picture-in-picture mode, there are a couple errors. 1) When in picture-in-picture mode, sometimes the Netflix screen will turn black.

It‚Äôs not really that big of a deal but a fix would make it a lot easier. 2) Also when in picture-in-picture mode, when the credits start to roll, it plays the credit music and the intro music overlapping each other. This can definitely get annoying and happens to me often when in picture-in-picture mode. It only shows the credits screen however-and the screen goes black if I go back into normal mode. Honestly, if you could fix these two issues, it would definitely help me keep watching Netflix smoothly.",4,2022-04-23 12:50:27,netflix,363590051

Very toxic,False,NayahOfficial,"You guys raise my blood pressure, give me hope, and let me down at the same time. I was over joyed when i found out that my favorite movie (Batman the Dark Knight) was out on netflix. It has become my comfort movie. I decided to watch it tonight not realizing that you manipulators took it off!!!! I am very upset and wish you guys would not make the netflix environment so TOXIC whew... since i can‚Äôt watch batman i decided to rewatch criminal minds then getting upset AGAIN because you guys refuse to put all the seasons on there. I really hope you guys be the bigger person and put these things on it would make my subscription so much more enjoyable. I hate that i love you- nbüñ§ 

I‚Äôm writing this June 12, 2022. The review above was written sometime last year.

It has come to my attention that CRIMINAL MINDS IS BEING REMOVED FROM NETFLIX! I am distraught! I am angry, and most of all I feel used! WHY???? Just why????? What do you guys gain from this? You add wack netflix originals then take the shows that people enjoy the most off. You guys are killing me. I asked for y‚Äôall to add the rest of the seasons and instead you say you‚Äôre removing the wholeeeee show! I don‚Äôt know what to say right now. I watch this show when I‚Äôm eating, when I‚Äôm cleaning, when I need a background noise, or when I just wanna watch it. Cmon pleaseeeee I‚Äôm begging you. I won‚Äôt ask for anything else just DONT take this off.

Amazing but some recommendations,False,Jenn fo short,"I love this app. My friends and me absolutely LOVE the following: Ginny and Georgia, Riverdale, OuterBanks, Vampire Diaries. We were wondering if you could add some more shows like that to Netflix? I mean obviously by the shows I wrote down we love gore, violence, drama, and some types of romance. One thing I would like is a pre-teen section and a teen section. It‚Äôs very hard to find shows and stuff that teens like to watch with no extreme nud!ty. It‚Äôs also hard to find PG-13 and PG-14 shows that aren‚Äôt super inappropriate. But the shows I wrote down don‚Äôt have that much inappropriate stuff in them. Again, we would LOVE more shows like this because I am a netflixaholic and I can‚Äôt take finishing an amazing show for the 10TH TIME THIS WEEK! But overall this app is a 5‚≠êÔ∏è app and I completely recommend. Plus, it‚Äôs very cheap! Love you netflix! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2022-03-14 16:39:55,netflix,363590051
Was better a couple years ago,False,cn r great,"I‚Äôve had a subscription to Netflix for a couple years now and I absolutely loved it when I first got the subscription. As time went on that changed. One of the main problems I have with this app is the canceling of the best shows. They will cancel shows that a lot of people love just because the numbers went down a little, but then they will add the dumbest shows like the hype house show. I also wish they had a teen section. They have an adult and kids section but not a teen one. They also have shows/movies that should be rated pg-13 but are rated Mature. My last issue with Netflix is it‚Äôs hard to use. If I want to watch a show thats In my recently watched I have to scroll forever to find it. It‚Äôs also way too hard to log into to your account from someone else‚Äôs app. Altogether, this app used to be a lot better and easier to use until they started changing stuff.",3,2022-06-11 15:43:01,netflix,363590051
Suggestion,False,Rando7,"Great app. If I could change anything it would be the ability to hide shows/movies that you‚Äôve already watched or are not interested in watching  - this would avoid the tedious task of having to scroll through all of the shows/movies you‚Äôve already watched (or irrelevant shows you no longer want to sort through) and can focus more easily on what shows you haven‚Äôt seen yet.  Right now I rate the show so I know I‚Äôve watched it, but being able to hide them somehow (not permanently but conveniently) would be a huge help. Also, if you could search for specific shows or movies better‚Ä¶maybe via tags or hashtags? For example, if you want to watch a romantic comedy that‚Äôs PG13, or a Japanese show with dubbed voiceover English instead of subtitles. Just a few thoughts.

Thanks for the offer but I‚Äôd also rather spend less money on Disney plus and all these restrictions you have like people from other places can‚Äôt share an account is ridiculous. My grand parents can‚Äôt afford to spend that amount of money on something that isn‚Äôt even that good of a website to use. Not trying to be rude but it‚Äôs messed up that you taking so much stuff off of the entire Netflix no one has anything to watch. And you barley give us enough time to watch it. Also your not uploading a ton more movies and shows. You just lost a ton of loyal customers. Also, some ratings on shows are very inappropriate. They should not be that low of a rating for the things in the movies like that.

"After years of Netflix, probably going to cancel",False,islandlady91,"We have had Netflix for many years.  Recently we decided to downgrade to the basic plan, as we mainly watch on our iPads and did not think it would make much difference, but did≈Ñt realize only one of us could watch.  I rarely watch  Netflix these days, but thought I might watch tonight, but then my husband could not watch.  He says cancel and I am in agreement.  The programming is not great, there is rarely anything new any more, and the series I like to watch, the time in between is forever, so I forget what I am watching and like.  Also, seeing prices are higher and no new programs, I have Apple tv, Starz and other apps for much less money and better movies and series, so I think we are cancelling before we get charged for another month.  Covid took so many peoples incomes, so to see these companies raising prices, but not giving good service or decent programming, I am not willing to pay for that.",2,2022-05-07 01:13:19,netflix,363590051
PLEASE READ,False,Alyssa3201,"I love this app as much as any other person but the one request i want to make is like for a show that is part of a collection there should be the choice while watching to switch over to another thing in the collection. Like if you are watching the vampire diaries and want to compare a scene to a scene for one of the other shows in the collection there should be a button titles collections while you are watching one of them you can click that button and it brings up the shows in the collection and if it is a show also shows you the shows too. For instance, if you are watching TVD 1x01 and want to compare it to Legacies 2x07 when both Damon and Landon say the line ‚ÄúHello brother‚Äù or TVD 6x17 and Legacies 3x01 when both Damon and Landon say ‚ÄúThis better be good‚Äù if you just want to compare the context of the scene and the setting and everything. 

Also another thing that i wish to say is i like half the stuff on here but anything you start watching either gets taken off or canceled but my thing is im stuck rewatching the same few thing because of this i wish you would put some of the stuff on here and put more historical stuff and also get some of the rights from Apple TV to add Dickinson i have nowhere to watch it and it is at the top of my watchlist so i wish you could please and thank you

Needs to do better,False,This_Nick_Name_Was_Taken,"The lack of security authentication is what is deterring me not to recommend this service to anyone.

Audio keeps cutting out randomly,False,Zekusu Makisu,I have used Netflix for many years and I have to say that it is the least reliable streaming service I‚Äôve used compared to others. My main complaint is how quiet and soft the audio is compared to all other streaming platforms. I have to listen to movies and series at max volume on Netflix and it‚Äôs still too quiet. Also the audio cuts out several times for a few seconds every time I watch something on Netflix. It happens so often that it is distracting and prevents me from being able to enjoy the viewing. The audio issue on Netflix is a serious problem and it seems like they have no intention of fixing it or even caring about it as long as people are still willing to pay for a Netflix subscription they don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt see any other reason why the audio problems have not been addressed yet. If I want to watch a movie without audio problems I have to find it from another source because the quality of Netflix is unreliable.,1,2022-06-23 04:58:07,netflix,363590051

Paying 4K prices but Netflix keeps crippling features,False,Nobosi,"Netflix has gone from being a first class experience a few years ago to constantly handicapping itself on Apple platforms for reasons that just seem self-serving on Netflix‚Äôs part.

Edit: Lo and behold Netflix is again raising prices. Honestly, you‚Äôre best off just only subscribing for a month to watch your shows and then cancel. They‚Äôre pricing it into their costs now so staying subscribed all the time is just not sustainable. Add in Netflix looking at nanny features for when you stream outside your ‚Äúhome‚Äù network and Netflix is looking a lot like cable - bloated, overpriced, and not worth it.",1,2022-03-16 17:39:32,netflix,363590051

While you‚Äôre at it, enabling screenshots to work would allow people to capture and share notable moments to help generate more of an organic buzz around a show.

You keep upping your prices and then you don‚Äôt even have the decency to leave people alone. No other service does this. No other service doesn‚Äôt let you watch on other screens without charging stupid prices to do so. I literally have to walk in my living room and make sure my ROKU is on the Home Screen sometimes all because I‚Äôm trying to continue watching my show or movie in my bedroom. Some people don‚Äôt have remote controls.

Accessibility.
With newer updates to the app, i can‚Äôt figure out how to change the profile picture on accounts. i‚Äôve tried everything even going on the website, but it won‚Äôt let me. I can‚Äôt even add a new account. I also can‚Äôt delete an account without hassle because i have to go to the website instead of the app and go through a long process.

2.
Screen recordings and screenshots.
Please let us take screenshots recording and screenshots, we find things funny and want to take a photo, or we want to show a certain moment of a show to someone far away, but we can‚Äôt. Because we can‚Äôt screen record or screenshot. Really, what do you think will happen? We should be able to share clips around of our favorite moments, instead we have to record our tv screen, but that never has clear videos and nobody wants to do that.

Other than that, great app. just please fix these. It would be better for everyone. I‚Äôve asked around, people agree. (especially about the 2nd thing.)

A lot of their content is already lame and very burned out and they have very few fresh movies. During Covid they cobbled together some very lame movies featured well-known actors that they really made those actors look bad because you could tell the movies were very rushed and not well thought out

Missing titles,False,a guy that is annoyed,This only happens on the app. At random times some shows will just disappear off of Netflix but it only happens on the app on my phone. I I was watching a show on my phone and went on Netflix an hour after previously watching it on my phone and it just disappeared. Wouldn‚Äôt even show up in the search bar. But I‚Äôve tested this and went on my tv to find it and it was still in my recently watched. Even google said it was still available on Netflix but I couldn‚Äôt get it to show up on my phone. Idk if this is a bug or what but it gets annoying when I wanna watch a show on my phone and i can‚Äôt watch it because it won‚Äôt show up even though It should still be there if it‚Äôs still available on Netflix and it shows up for me on my tv,2,2022-03-21 15:43:34,netflix,363590051
Deleted downloads,False,Hdhsisosbshzopa,"It deleted all of my downloads, I usually don‚Äôt have Netflix connected to cellular data, but I needed to pull up the cast of a certain show to win an argument and my friend wasn‚Äôt believing to google results, so I connected to Netflix to cellular and showed them, and then turn cellular back off. I go back 30 minutes later to watch my show that I downloaded, and it‚Äôs been deleted??? The show is still on the platform, I checked, I can even still watch it over cellular if I wanted to waste my data! Now I can‚Äôt redownload my show until I find a shop with wifi because my hotel doesn‚Äôt have any!!! This is a HUGE inconvenience.

If the rating actually does disappear, it comes right back if I accidentally give my screen even the slightest tap.  Then don‚Äôt even get me started on the recommendations.  I dislike every kid show and anime crap and Netflix just doubles down and shoves the ‚Äúkids‚Äù and ‚Äúanime‚Äù category to the top.  All the rest of the categories are just the same 15 shows with just a different category name.  Don‚Äôt want to watch Hannah Montana as a ‚Äúfamily movie‚Äù?  What about if we call it a comedy?  No?

FIX YOUR DOWNLOAD FEATURE,False,Andrew and Star,"One of the only reasons I have Netflix as an app on my phone(when I can easily watch it on the TV or my computer) is because I can download things to watch. for a while, this process was pretty simple: click what you want to download, leave the tab open, give it a few minutes, and hazza‚Äîit‚Äôs been downloaded. But more recently I‚Äôve been having to /watch/ my phone, practically babysitting it, because if I walk away from it and it turns off for *one second* the entire download will be lost.

Falling behind competition,False,Newsgirl6,"While Netflix used to be the best, now they just canceled good shows, they keep making only one or two seasons of a show and then canceling it. Only really dumb stuff seems to get a lot of seasons. The only really reason to keep Netflix is if you want to binge old shows, though they keep disappearing too. And then for all this they keep upping the price every six months or so, and now they want to crack down on password sharing, yet they are the only streaming provider that doesn‚Äôt offer 4K streaming at every Price option. The only way their 4K option makes sense is if you‚Äôre sharing with people. Sure I would want 4K for just myself but they only offer it in the big option.

Pushy Optionless garbage app,False,gintanto,"I'll start by admitting that it plays videos really well.  Which is good.
But nothing pisses me off quite as much as when I get to the thoughtful end of a long series and instead of letting the credits roll, they give me 5 seconds to hit the X before shoving the next video in my face, without even letting me choose which one.

What about OPTIONS? There is an option screen and it has about 4 settings to control downloads and that is it.  Is it too much to ask that the millions they pay their team to develop this app that maybe just maybe they could add settings to control its autoplay behavior?

For that matter, I also hate the main selection system.  Netflix has a massive catalog, but they only show you the things ""you want to see"", and they're wrong more often than right.  The only way to actually explore the full catalog is to know the name in advance and type it into the search.

Add in that they cancel things after the earlier season sets us up for the next that never comes, and I'm just not a happy customer right now.  (looking at Cowboy Bebop that didn't get season 2, grr)",2,2022-08-18 08:51:22,netflix,363590051

an annoying feature.,False,Walgreenphotoappisawasteoftime,"this goes for any and every device. 
i absolutely hate the ""Skip Intro"" button. its not being able to skip it thats annoying, its the automation. 
if youre confused, sometimes if you click ""Skip Intro"" on the first episode of any show it will automatically skip it for every other episode.
the problem with this is that for basically all of the shows on netflix, on the first episode there is NEVER the option to skip the intro.
so basically for the rest of show, you have to deal with clicking the ""Skip Intro"" button each and every time. for most people, this isnt a big deal. but for someone who is constantly busy and is doing other stuff while listening to a show, its super annoying.

Solution:
make an option to always skip intro. whether thats a pop up or in a settings, there should be an option to always skip the intro. and if youre wondering; ""well what if i wanted to watch it that time?"" then go back and watch it. then maybe for the rest of the show it doesnt skip the intro. simple as that.",3,2022-05-24 01:44:15,netflix,363590051

Then one August after a recent price increase and football season on the horizon I decided to turn off (cancel) Netflix for a couple maybe three months. This would balance out the price hikes and when I‚Äôd return it would have a fresh look. 
  I believe the price was $8. Raising to $9. With 25 million scripts.
Now with hundreds of millions of subscribers rates keep increasing

The last show that netflix has left for me to watch is leaving at the end of the month. So now I have zero reason to come on here. Maybe you should focus on bringing back the shows everyone liked instead of producing crappy tv shows that no one wants to watch.

Heating issue + stuck after Netflix logo during app startup,False,az_zoha,"iPhone 12 Pro
Constantly plagued with heating issues where my phone would get uncharacteristically hot on the backside, beside the camera module. 

Clearing the app from memory and reloading helps with the heating issues but that introduces another. 

Sometimes when the app is cleared from memory, the app refuses to go past the Netflix logo animation where profiles can be selected. Just an infinite spinner animation after the Netflix logo animation and that‚Äôs it! No matter how many times I clear the app from memory this problem doesn‚Äôt go away until I have to RESTART MY DEVICE! 

According to a quick lookup on this issue on the internet, I have come across many others complaining about the same problem since mid 2021. And now, we‚Äôre halfway through 2022 and this is yet not fixed!

Greedy companies deserve to fail,False,aksdssd,Netflix used to offer a good selection of shows for a reasonable price. More recently however they‚Äôve lost most of the shows I used to love on the service.

Unfortunately there seems to be nothing to show for the increase in price. Beyond that they‚Äôre now disallowing account sharing across households and are planning on introducing ads to the service.

Exit,False,uuuuhhhhgggggg,"The new update has moved the ‚Äúexit Netflix‚Äù button to the right side. Which would be fine except for the navigation only allowing you to move to the right side by going all the way to the bottom, where it was before, then you can click 2 more times to the right‚Ä¶ just not user friendly, I know many may not use this function but I do every time I use the app and this has just become a little less user friendly",5,2022-04-27 02:15:53,netflix,363590051
PLEASE READ AND RESPOND!,False,Arianna 539.,"I LOVE Netflix, it‚Äôs basically the only thing I watch. But I have one problem with it, there should be a TV-14 category to choose from. I have my own Netflix account, and want the setting to be on TV-14. If there are shows and movies on Netflix that have the age rating TV-14, there should be an age category for TV-14. There are shows that I love, like Stranger Things and Cobra Kai.. But It‚Äôs rated TV-14, and my account is currently set to  pg-13. So, it would be helpful to have a TV-14 age category on Netflix. Please respond to this comment. Thanks.",5,2022-04-16 19:23:58,netflix,363590051
"Keep taking down good movies, and will punish you for having more than one device",False,unityumbra,"Ive got a couple smart tvs a phone and an iPad, and they insist on trying to get me to switch to family plan,despite these all being my devices. 
You could argue this is a data issue, to try and limit each persons use, but netflix is the only app thats given me trouble for having multiple devices.
The options are also much more limited in quality than they were a year ago, especially with movies. Theres plenty of shows, but most good movies get taken down.

Netflix was one of the first big movie streaming apps,  but right now they're not the best.",2,2022-02-22 14:36:46,netflix,363590051
Please stop removing shows!,False,lilshrimplet,"I really like Netflix, but there are some flaws. I started watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood in the beginning of December, and I was disappointed to find out that it was going to get removed on December 31st. Because my schedule is very busy, I don‚Äôt have much time to watch it, and I was unable to finish the show. I was also sad to see Titanic taken off. Also, can you please add an option to delete your continue watching? I‚Äôve had some animes that I dropped that are still on my Continue Watching list.",4,2022-02-14 19:39:20,netflix,363590051
Still needs a lot of work,False,jomodogwood,"It‚Äôs obvious that Netflix is a liberal run company.  A lot of shows I was watching have changed to pander to liberal views. Whatever, I just stopped watching them. 
Other issues I‚Äôm having are, while watching a series, if I stop a show and come back later, it starts back at a different episode but doesn‚Äôt seem to remember where I stopped at. 
Another thing I wish there was a feature for is, after I have finished watching a movie or series, I wish it would have a way to flag it so just looking through shows or movies, I can see what I have finished.",3,2022-07-31 21:41:30,netflix,363590051

Amazing app but seriously so annoying...,False,ANIMAL LOVER!üê∫üê∫üêïüêïüêàüêàüê∂,"Ok, I‚Äôve had this app since I was really little. But, I‚Äôm here to ask, why do you guys keep canceling shows? For example, my favorite series, ‚ÄúCreeped Out‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Leftovers‚Äù needs more seasons! I‚Äôve been rewatching all of these episodes, but I really wish I could watch new episodes! These shows have kept me entertained during Covid..and still are. But, I would be more than happy if these shows came out with new seasons. Overall, this app is very recommended! Thank you for reading this far! Thanks Netflix!‚ù§Ô∏è",4,2022-07-17 02:34:20,netflix,363590051
Netflix show series keep getting canceled,False,Casteox,"Here's the problem. New Netflix TV shows (with series of episodes) keep getting canceled with a cliffhanger. From now on, I'll just watch movies and avoid shows that has a chance of being canceled. It didn't matter if TV shows were in the Top 10 for weeks. These shows still got canceled. It's a game of chance if I'm going to invest time, energy and money watching any more Netflix shows. I'm still subscribed because of friends and families, but there's still a chance I'll cancel Netflix.",4,2022-04-27 12:55:44,netflix,363590051
Needs Better Accessibility Options,False,RosinSlayer,"It‚Äôs incredibly hard to read the English subtitles for the Korean Dramas on Netflix. Especially when the scenes have incredibly light colors. The white text without any shadowing or dark bars is nearly impossible to read unless the scenes are in a dark location. (Which most of the time it‚Äôs incredibly well lit.)
I‚Äôd love to be able to enjoy the shows at the same/similar level of ease as anyone else.
Please add some customization options for subtitles! (If you can‚Äôt do that at least add a background to the existing subtitles.)
I really appreciate your time, thank you!",3,2022-05-11 02:20:29,netflix,363590051
Pose,False,ammyheredia,"Y‚Äôall really had the take down a African American, Latino LGBTQ and gander-nonconforming drag ball culture. Like I was watching even if I already watched it I was going to watch it again then my tv turned off when I turned it back on and I tried finding POSE and I wasn‚Äôt there I was literally not done with it because I was writing a international woman‚Äôs day since todays March. And I wanted to write about the trans woman in the show now I can‚Äôt watch non because it‚Äôs not on Netflix anymore.

We need more LGBTQ shoes and people transforming into what they wanted to be for a while now but now üòê deleting Netflix YALL still doing the same thing taking down shows even some other shows people haven‚Äôt started yet or is in a few episodes in",1,2022-03-01 08:57:59,netflix,363590051
App Suggestion,False,Mayday.May,"App usually works fine and I can tell when my phone needs to update cause usually the Netflix app won‚Äôt work and the screen will go blank (with audio playing) nearing the end of the episodes. Admittedly the usability is one of the best. 
My kid got acquainted with using the app and can spot the logo but I wish there was a Netflix Kids app because he doesn‚Äôt know how to choose profiles and will end up playing some graphic shows until he finds his favorite kid shows in the suggestions. 
Please Netflix, can you consider a kids app where it has an age limit for kid appropriate shows.",3,2022-02-09 00:33:07,netflix,363590051
