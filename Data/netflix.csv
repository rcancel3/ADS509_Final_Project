🌹Sex video call👉8kau.com🌹菝,Great app,4,I’ve been using Netflix for 5 years and now I\'m older i want to ask 1. Add a pre-teen and teenager setting where the shows for kids in kindergarten aren’t there and the setting should have barely any gore no nudity drugs or substance abuse and no adult content. It should have a survey that the teens/ preteens can find stuff they like to watch. 2.the ratings When Netflix rates stuff they barely look at it they just slap a rating on it. And thats not good considering some shows don’t even QUALIFY for the ratings Overall a great app but there are some things that could be better Like Bunk’d it has fear sure but its not as if it’s always there and it’s annoying seeing it pop up and its not even true like 75% of the time. 3.getting rid of good shows and keeping bad ones. The shows can be awful but stay on Netflix and the good ones get deleted off of Netflix. Like some animes like there’s god awful ones that almost no one likes but still stay on the platform but then shows that are great get deleted I don’t understand it. And 4. Seasons for shows. So if go to anywhere else and watch shows like bunk’d Henry danger or miraculous lady bug it has all the episodes of them cause they are finished while on Netflix its like 2-3 seasons on the show and its been like this for like 2 almost 3 years now and it’s bad because henry danger is actually over and missing 2 seasons and miraculous is missing a season so please fix it. But over this a great app,2022-10-02 22:00:08,False,netflix,363590051

ApatheticDread999,Trash,1,"I use a VPN to protect my privacy and the app always throws a fit about it because it will block me out of being to watch anything, even though the VPN has my location set to the same state i am in. ALSO whenever i try to watch something it has a habit of trying to connect to the TV. i didn’t change anything in the settings, i dont use my phone to cast to the TV because the TV itself is wonky, it didn’t ask me if i wanted to, i didn’t tap anywhere near the cast icon, but it does it anyways, all while my sister is trying to watch a movie with a friend in the other room. In other words, I cant watch my show without turning the wifi off because it would disturb others in the household and i cant do anything to fix it. This is a garbage app run by a company that thinks its okay to purchase the rights to JoJos bizarre adventure and stop the fans from enjoying the show like we always have, like we always do with every other anime. which is weekly updates. Noooo these losers want to force us to wait a year for a set of 12 episodes that you know we’re gonna blaze through because we are starved for the story, if you ever binge watched a show you know your mind doesn’t retain very much compared to watching an episode a week. Where you can immediately hop online after watching it and have so much to talk about with fellow fans on just that one episode, and with each episode the hype builds up and you get more excited for the episode to be released the following week.",2022-09-12 06:31:26,False,netflix,363590051
AwesoMapes,IDEA FROM A CONSUMER/VIEWER.,4,"I was scrolling through Netflix and I had a wonderful thought so I decided to act on it and write to Netflix through this review. There are plenty of times when I’m scrolling through Netflix and I am trying to avoid nudity in shows and movies. Wouldn’t it be great if there were a way to toggle on and off all shows that have a specific tag instead of just the rating? For example, there are plenty of shows that are rated TV-MA and don’t have nudity that are great to watch. However, you have to filter them all yourself and check the rating before hand and it takes up a lot of time when looking for something new to view. Now, imagine if I can just go to me settings page and toggle on and off certain tags to make my browsing easier by removing shows/movies with the tag from appearing during your browsing. Now I know that doing it with every single tag would be a pain in the behind but just doing the major tags would help out a lot of people I think.

I also, want to explain what I mean by tag in the case it isn’t clear. I’m not talking about genre such as thriller, action. Etc. I’m talking about the tags associated with the rating system like nudity, extreme violence, adult content, adult language, etc.",2022-03-13 15:55:06,False,netflix,363590051
cmm472,Still ad-free and affordable,4,"I have subscribed to Netflix for years, left for a while and recently returned. I have seen quite a few good series over the years (The Last Dance, The Queen’s Gambit, and others). Downton Abbey is available to stream, and I’m happy to see that there is going to be another season of Atypical. Of all the streaming services that I’ve tried, they have the best mix of programming. The app is well organized on my streaming player. The recommendation algorithm is getting better, and there is a large library to search. I wanted to add that personally I’m glad they are cracking down on password sharing.  I’ve never thought it was fair that the honest subscribers were absorbing the cost for those who thought it was okay to take advantage. I am referring to people who share passwords with friends and family residing in other households.  Also, it’s interesting that the people complaining the loudest regarding “Cuties” and the “woke agenda” are the ones who seem to be watching these shows.  I never knew those things existed on Netflix until they were pointed out because there is so much other programming to watch.  If you don’t like it, skip it and move on.",2022-04-24 14:48:14,False,netflix,363590051
A_J_C11,Teens account,4,"Hi Netflix and anyone reading this!
I think Netflix should have a teens account. For me personally I’m only allowed to have a kids account and I’m sure many people can relate. To be honest some things on the kids account are good movies. But for people 10 and older that need to have a kids account need a higher selection…sometimes I can watch the grown up account with parent supervision but I would rather just have a my own account. Right now I barley use my kids account and watch the grown up account but some parents don’t feel comfortable. Their kid can hide their phone and could be watching  weird inappropriate things. On the grownups account most things are rated R but some things don’t need to be on there like Stranger Things  and other shows etc. But on a kids account there are things for babies or little kids like Cocomelon. There is a grown up and a kid but their needs to be an in between. I don’t understand why Tall Girl is on the kids account. If someone who watches coco melon watches Tall  Girl  they will see boyfriends and girlfriends that 2 year olds shouldn’t see. Anyway, I think their should be a teens account. 
Thank you for your time.",2022-05-05 00:44:22,False,netflix,363590051
Jdndncmaljen,Y’all are mid,1,Honestly y’all are made you don’t have no good anime shows you don’t have no good regular shows I feel like y’all should step up your game and add shows that people want to watch and that people are actually interested In and how y’all were talking about charging people if they share passwords that’s not OK that was like a invasion of privacy I feel like y’all are just looking for the money in this while this is a business you giys should still be looking out for your customers best interest because it’s a way for y’all to make enough money and also give us what we want to watch that’s how you gonna get more subscribers everybody is dropping y’all and going to other people. Add demon slayer season 2 for one also y’all have so many unfinished shows that we need to see the end of adding new shows while not finishing old ones makes y’all mid yall seem lazy I understand if y’all are not able to get the shows but come on now be real tired of putting up with bare minimum my 15 or 14 dollars matter to right ?

AFTER YOU WATCH ALL THE GOOD STUFF THERES NOTHING LEFT HBOMAX MAKES YALL LOOK BAD AND THEY HAVE OLD SHOWS BORN IN 06 WATCHING OLDIES BUT GOODIES BECAUSE YALL WONT GET YALL ACT TOGETHER .

IfYou're555ThenI'm666,Some problems I would like to talk about no hate,2,"I used to have Netflix but now I unsubscribed and uninstalled and I would like to give some feedback why. 
First of all, Netflix price started getting really expensive and I think it’s kind of outrageous. Second of all, I feel like there should be teen section where it is not like for kids to watch and nothing too much going on like way too much gore, blood, yet no nudity and sexual content but kissing is fine and not way too much strong language and stuff like that. Because I’m not into kids stuff nor nothing way too adult going on (I can handle gore btw), I think it would be better because some teens don’t like watching stuff for kids nor nothing way too inappropriate for teens to watch.
Another reason why is that the movies and shows is being cancelled and now you can’t complete like the whole series or episodes or whatever.
I don’t know why Netflix have to be expensive it could be better at the lowest $5 and the premium where you watch bonus content, uncut version of movies or more exclusive features like no advertisements at $12. That be more fair for me in my opinion and I’m just disappointed how Netflix is now. But few years back I used to enjoy it a lot.",2022-02-12 18:04:07,False,netflix,363590051

Ima start with the positive side of this app and then move to why I hate it. Netflix entertains me a lot! I am glad it has a variety of shows to watch! But I love this anime called Demon Slayer and Netflix doesn’t even like to put the other seasons, it’s just like other shows, they don’t keep most updated. The only ones they keep updated are Stranger Things and adult shows. Out of all the entertainment apps I think this one is the worst! Netflix pls update Demon Slayer. I want to know what happens, and Netflix haven’t updated it ever since Netflix put it on the app. I want everyone to read this is also the company that owns Netflix. I am tired of Netflix not caring about the people who love their shows and don’t update them. Honestly I think this is why people aren’t using Netflix that often. Thank you for your time. Please Netflix update the shows you have for us. I love this app, it’s just that I have nothing to do and all I watch is demon slayer, but now that I don’t have it updated and can’t get any other apps I am frustrated.

justnobodyreally,App works but has bugs,2,"The app works but without exaggerating, I run into bugs almost every time I use the app. This is because my most frequent interactions (pausing and rewinding) for watching stuff HAVE BUGS. (1) Pausing and resuming video will make upcoming subtitles skip. So I need to rewind to catch the subtitles. Which brings up (2) rewinding more than once will cause video to freeze so I need to close and reopen the show (this gets annoying when it’s near the end of an episode so it opens the next one instead). And I need to rewind more than once very often because of the first bug. An example of this scenario is if I pause video and resume. Then it shows the current subtitle, but then the subtitle after is skipped. So I need to rewind back twice, which causes the video to freeze. I really feel like Netflix should have fixed pausing and rewinding video correctly by now since these are basic parts of playing video. It’s incredibly frustrating to get hit with 2 back to back bugs very frequently, especially if it causes you to miss part of the end of an episode and closing/reopening the frozen video makes you start off in the next episode.",2022-02-08 11:19:14,False,netflix,363590051
ace20201,What’s going on?,1,"I LOVE Netflix, but the things they have been doing lately.... I don't quite understand. First, taking off a lot of the good movies/tv shows. A lot of people including myself, have a subscription to Netflix because of the content that's on their platform. But here lately a bunch of the content that us users subscribe to see is being taken of the platform. Those movies/tv shows includes The Vampire Diaries, Criminal Minds, Halloween, The Conjuring, and much more. I don't understand why Netflix is doing this, because the content on the platform is one of the main reasons people are even subscribing to Netflix. Next, bringing ads to Netflix. I have heard rumors about Netflix bringing ads to their platform in early 2023, but never expected it to actually happen. Being one of the very little number of platforms that are ad free is an additional reason that Netflix is so popular. A lot of people like ad free services where they don't get interruptions in the middle of a good tv show and/or movie. I don't understand bringing ads to Netflix because feel that this would be bad for company revenue.

Update: I changed the rating cause you put Criminal Minds back on then took it off again.",2022-08-27 03:53:38,False,netflix,363590051
netflix is mid now :(,Netflix pick up your game,1,"So lately this might just be me but Netflix will stop playing my show and give me the circle of annoyance. It has also been getting rid of a lot of good shows. I know this was a few years ago and I know where it is now but why did you get rid of clone wars (a show loved by all) before Disney+ was even talked about being made. There is a ton of other shows too. Like why have the Naruto shippuden movies but not the show, I mean you have shonen jumps. Another thing is during my episodes the audio will completely cut, I can still see things but not hear them and I have to restart the app. Also why can’t you make a teen option as other people have stated so that people can watch like pg-13 without all the tv-ma stuff so that people can watch shows on there own account. And about the audio cut thing, I have called customer support before about the audio and they said I’m a liar and that I’m the only one with this issue (which is not true it happens to other people I know) honestly Netflix your lucky this is my favorite platform or it would have a 1 star.

SjageDaMae,The summaries,4,"Some titles have summaries that just say who is in the movie and who directed it. That information is cool but not at the expense of what the actual film or show is about. It doesn’t make sense to have a movie summary say “Leading Actor/Actress is an award nominee who teamed with award winning film director” that has nothing to do with the premise of the story and it’s annoying to see a movie and not know what it’s about, especially since these particular ones usually have trailers that tell very little. Again they’re basically teaser trailers that just show who’s in it and what film festival said about it. Even the great Martin Scorsese has directed a dud film or two. Please just tell me what it’s about rather than telling me the cast. There’s already a section where people can see who helped work on the project. It would be nice to keep them separate because when I’m trying to find something to watch I want to know what I’m watching, not who.

They should put a voting option for the viewers if they want it still be kept in netflix. They also replace the series/movie with bad ones that have bad acting or no plot. OR they keep the bad movies etc and cancel good ones. If they still had a few movies and series i would use it 24/7 but not i only use it once a month and just find the series/movie some else where.

I also think there should be more pride movies you have a lot of romantic movies with straight people I feel like there should be more because there love matters just as much and they have good meanings to them and teach a lesson. Recently I watched a movie called hidden kisses and it should get lesson out there because hating on your own child for making there own Decisions it can affect them more then you know one person judging them could make them want to end there life.

But now look at you, you guys cancelled numerous series, shows, and movies, that we all loved and could watch over and over and over again without getting bored. You guys air great shows and all of a sudden that become discontinued. I will not be surprised if you guys lose 37% of your watchers in these years that may come. I am very devastated to see that some shows that I love watching won’t have a next season. It also breaks my heart that some good movies that some people haven’t seen were taken off of Netflix. Now those new subscribers that you may gain won’t have the opportunity to watch those amazingly well out movies because you took them off. I understand that you guys may take off movies or series to put in new ones, but instead of taking away the shows they love take other shows that people don’t find you amusing.

I suggest changing the rating on some shows because they are inappropriate for little kids. Like naruto is literally in the section good for family in the kids profile.

It’s not really that big of a deal but a fix would make it a lot easier. 2) Also when in picture-in-picture mode, when the credits start to roll, it plays the credit music and the intro music overlapping each other. This can definitely get annoying and happens to me often when in picture-in-picture mode. It only shows the credits screen however-and the screen goes black if I go back into normal mode. Honestly, if you could fix these two issues, it would definitely help me keep watching Netflix smoothly.",2022-04-23 12:50:27,False,netflix,363590051

NayahOfficial,Very toxic,3,"You guys raise my blood pressure, give me hope, and let me down at the same time. I was over joyed when i found out that my favorite movie (Batman the Dark Knight) was out on netflix. It has become my comfort movie. I decided to watch it tonight not realizing that you manipulators took it off!!!! I am very upset and wish you guys would not make the netflix environment so TOXIC whew... since i can’t watch batman i decided to rewatch criminal minds then getting upset AGAIN because you guys refuse to put all the seasons on there. I really hope you guys be the bigger person and put these things on it would make my subscription so much more enjoyable. I hate that i love you- nb🖤 

I’m writing this June 12, 2022. The review above was written sometime last year.

It has come to my attention that CRIMINAL MINDS IS BEING REMOVED FROM NETFLIX! I am distraught! I am angry, and most of all I feel used! WHY???? Just why????? What do you guys gain from this? You add wack netflix originals then take the shows that people enjoy the most off. You guys are killing me. I asked for y’all to add the rest of the seasons and instead you say you’re removing the wholeeeee show! I don’t know what to say right now. I watch this show when I’m eating, when I’m cleaning, when I need a background noise, or when I just wanna watch it. Cmon pleaseeeee I’m begging you. I won’t ask for anything else just DONT take this off. 
Talk to you soon- nb🖤",2022-06-12 05:50:34,False,netflix,363590051
Jenn fo short,Amazing but some recommendations,5,"I love this app. My friends and me absolutely LOVE the following: Ginny and Georgia, Riverdale, OuterBanks, Vampire Diaries. We were wondering if you could add some more shows like that to Netflix? I mean obviously by the shows I wrote down we love gore, violence, drama, and some types of romance. One thing I would like is a pre-teen section and a teen section. It’s very hard to find shows and stuff that teens like to watch with no extreme nud!ty. It’s also hard to find PG-13 and PG-14 shows that aren’t super inappropriate. But the shows I wrote down don’t have that much inappropriate stuff in them. Again, we would LOVE more shows like this because I am a netflixaholic and I can’t take finishing an amazing show for the 10TH TIME THIS WEEK! But overall this app is a 5⭐️ app and I completely recommend. Plus, it’s very cheap! Love you netflix! ❤️",2022-03-14 16:39:55,False,netflix,363590051
cn r great,Was better a couple years ago,3,"I’ve had a subscription to Netflix for a couple years now and I absolutely loved it when I first got the subscription. As time went on that changed. One of the main problems I have with this app is the canceling of the best shows. They will cancel shows that a lot of people love just because the numbers went down a little, but then they will add the dumbest shows like the hype house show. I also wish they had a teen section. They have an adult and kids section but not a teen one. They also have shows/movies that should be rated pg-13 but are rated Mature. My last issue with Netflix is it’s hard to use. If I want to watch a show thats In my recently watched I have to scroll forever to find it. It’s also way too hard to log into to your account from someone else’s app. Altogether, this app used to be a lot better and easier to use until they started changing stuff.",2022-06-11 15:43:01,False,netflix,363590051
Rando7,Suggestion,5,"Great app. If I could change anything it would be the ability to hide shows/movies that you’ve already watched or are not interested in watching  - this would avoid the tedious task of having to scroll through all of the shows/movies you’ve already watched (or irrelevant shows you no longer want to sort through) and can focus more easily on what shows you haven’t seen yet.  Right now I rate the show so I know I’ve watched it, but being able to hide them somehow (not permanently but conveniently) would be a huge help. Also, if you could search for specific shows or movies better…maybe via tags or hashtags? For example, if you want to watch a romantic comedy that’s PG13, or a Japanese show with dubbed voiceover English instead of subtitles. Just a few thoughts.

Make more variety for kids and teens. On top of that you got rid of CRIMINAL MINDS. HOW COULD YOU. THATS THE BEST SHOW EVER. get rid of something else. Thanks for the offer but I’d also rather spend less money on Disney plus and all these restrictions you have like people from other places can’t share an account is ridiculous. My grand parents can’t afford to spend that amount of money on something that isn’t even that good of a website to use. Not trying to be rude but it’s messed up that you taking so much stuff off of the entire Netflix no one has anything to watch. And you barley give us enough time to watch it. Also your not uploading a ton more movies and shows. You just lost a ton of loyal customers. Also, some ratings on shows are very inappropriate. They should not be that low of a rating for the things in the movies like that.

islandlady91,"After years of Netflix, probably going to cancel",2,"We have had Netflix for many years.  Recently we decided to downgrade to the basic plan, as we mainly watch on our iPads and did not think it would make much difference, but didńt realize only one of us could watch.  I rarely watch  Netflix these days, but thought I might watch tonight, but then my husband could not watch.  He says cancel and I am in agreement.  The programming is not great, there is rarely anything new any more, and the series I like to watch, the time in between is forever, so I forget what I am watching and like.  Also, seeing prices are higher and no new programs, I have Apple tv, Starz and other apps for much less money and better movies and series, so I think we are cancelling before we get charged for another month.  Covid took so many peoples incomes, so to see these companies raising prices, but not giving good service or decent programming, I am not willing to pay for that.",2022-05-07 01:13:19,False,netflix,363590051
Alyssa3201,PLEASE READ,3,"I love this app as much as any other person but the one request i want to make is like for a show that is part of a collection there should be the choice while watching to switch over to another thing in the collection. Like if you are watching the vampire diaries and want to compare a scene to a scene for one of the other shows in the collection there should be a button titles collections while you are watching one of them you can click that button and it brings up the shows in the collection and if it is a show also shows you the shows too. For instance, if you are watching TVD 1x01 and want to compare it to Legacies 2x07 when both Damon and Landon say the line “Hello brother” or TVD 6x17 and Legacies 3x01 when both Damon and Landon say “This better be good” if you just want to compare the context of the scene and the setting and everything. 

Also another thing that i wish to say is i like half the stuff on here but anything you start watching either gets taken off or canceled but my thing is im stuck rewatching the same few thing because of this i wish you would put some of the stuff on here and put more historical stuff and also get some of the rights from Apple TV to add Dickinson i have nowhere to watch it and it is at the top of my watchlist so i wish you could please and thank you

Zekusu Makisu,Audio keeps cutting out randomly,1,I have used Netflix for many years and I have to say that it is the least reliable streaming service I’ve used compared to others. My main complaint is how quiet and soft the audio is compared to all other streaming platforms. I have to listen to movies and series at max volume on Netflix and it’s still too quiet. Also the audio cuts out several times for a few seconds every time I watch something on Netflix. It happens so often that it is distracting and prevents me from being able to enjoy the viewing. The audio issue on Netflix is a serious problem and it seems like they have no intention of fixing it or even caring about it as long as people are still willing to pay for a Netflix subscription they don’t care. I don’t see any other reason why the audio problems have not been addressed yet. If I want to watch a movie without audio problems I have to find it from another source because the quality of Netflix is unreliable.,2022-06-23 04:58:07,False,netflix,363590051

Nobosi,Paying 4K prices but Netflix keeps crippling features,1,"Netflix has gone from being a first class experience a few years ago to constantly handicapping itself on Apple platforms for reasons that just seem self-serving on Netflix’s part. I now am forced to give Netflix my credit card rather than through in-app purchase with Apple Pay, Apple TV app doesn’t support Bandersnatch, and now Netflix has stripped AirPlay out of the app. Here’s hoping Disney has better sense when they roll their streaming service and moves the Marvel content there as Netflix certainly hasn’t earned my loyalty.

Edit: Lo and behold Netflix is again raising prices. Honestly, you’re best off just only subscribing for a month to watch your shows and then cancel. They’re pricing it into their costs now so staying subscribed all the time is just not sustainable. Add in Netflix looking at nanny features for when you stream outside your “home” network and Netflix is looking a lot like cable - bloated, overpriced, and not worth it.",2022-03-16 17:39:32,False,netflix,363590051

Can't get a car2go,Really needs to work with SharePlay,3,"Netflix, come on. Please get with the times. Every single one of your competitors offers the ability to watch a show together through SharePlay. 

Many families, couples, friends are separated across geographies or just can’t be together in the same place for other reasons - being able to watch a show together through a FaceTime call helps bridge the gap. It’s silly that Netflix is the only app that doesn’t allow this. 

While you’re at it, enabling screenshots to work would allow people to capture and share notable moments to help generate more of an organic buzz around a show. Often, Netflix’s own marketing is not very good at doing this and a lot of shows don’t get enough support - because no one knows about them - and they’re cancelled after a few seasons.

badmoodues,Ridiculous,1,If you cared at all about your customers you’d spare that tiny bit of bandwidth to allow people who pay for their service to just watch what they’re watching without hassling people who’ve worked all day or week to get up 30 times to let you know if they’re still watching. You keep upping your prices and then you don’t even have the decency to leave people alone. No other service does this. No other service doesn’t let you watch on other screens without charging stupid prices to do so. I literally have to walk in my living room and make sure my ROKU is on the Home Screen sometimes all because I’m trying to continue watching my show or movie in my bedroom. Some people don’t have remote controls. Some ppl aren’t able to just easily go back and forth and some people can’t afford to keep paying you higher amounts when your customers aren’t even worth using bandwidth.,2022-05-02 02:47:19,False,netflix,363590051

1.
Accessibility.
With newer updates to the app, i can’t figure out how to change the profile picture on accounts. i’ve tried everything even going on the website, but it won’t let me. I can’t even add a new account. I also can’t delete an account without hassle because i have to go to the website instead of the app and go through a long process.

2.
Screen recordings and screenshots.
Please let us take screenshots recording and screenshots, we find things funny and want to take a photo, or we want to show a certain moment of a show to someone far away, but we can’t. Because we can’t screen record or screenshot. Really, what do you think will happen? We should be able to share clips around of our favorite moments, instead we have to record our tv screen, but that never has clear videos and nobody wants to do that.

Other than that, great app. just please fix these. It would be better for everyone. I’ve asked around, people agree. (especially about the 2nd thing.)

My other reason is that for Netflix to add ALL of the seasons in a show. I was watching this show that I really like, so I goggled it, and I saw that is had 4 seasons, not one.

Thingsyourollup,Clunky and unusable on mobile,1,"There is zero sync between what I watch on my PC and what I watch on my phone. And on my phone, half of the screen is taken up by TV ratings that will NOT go away, almost like I give a crap what a group of uptight prudes in Hollywood think I should and shouldn’t be watching. If the rating actually does disappear, it comes right back if I accidentally give my screen even the slightest tap.  Then don’t even get me started on the recommendations.  I dislike every kid show and anime crap and Netflix just doubles down and shoves the “kids” and “anime” category to the top.  All the rest of the categories are just the same 15 shows with just a different category name.  Don’t want to watch Hannah Montana as a “family movie”?  What about if we call it a comedy?  No?

Andrew and Star,FIX YOUR DOWNLOAD FEATURE,1,"One of the only reasons I have Netflix as an app on my phone(when I can easily watch it on the TV or my computer) is because I can download things to watch. for a while, this process was pretty simple: click what you want to download, leave the tab open, give it a few minutes, and hazza—it’s been downloaded. But more recently I’ve been having to /watch/ my phone, practically babysitting it, because if I walk away from it and it turns off for *one second* the entire download will be lost. Today I sat through doing this TWICE for at least an hour each for the same video, because through some random glitch my entire download got deleted the first time.

Only really dumb stuff seems to get a lot of seasons. The only really reason to keep Netflix is if you want to binge old shows, though they keep disappearing too. And then for all this they keep upping the price every six months or so, and now they want to crack down on password sharing, yet they are the only streaming provider that doesn’t offer 4K streaming at every Price option. The only way their 4K option makes sense is if you’re sharing with people. Sure I would want 4K for just myself but they only offer it in the big option.

It would get 10% of most viewers then you get in a year. And instead of canceling shows.. just make them a limited series! And if the places are too full to add new movies then delete the useless ones. For example the ones that people don’t ever watch and don’t know about. Like country comfort or how I fell inlove with a gangster and spider-man cartoons. Thanks and also add Harry Potter and make English subtitles more clearer and bigger.

gintanto,Pushy Optionless garbage app,2,"I'll start by admitting that it plays videos really well.  Which is good.
But nothing pisses me off quite as much as when I get to the thoughtful end of a long series and instead of letting the credits roll, they give me 5 seconds to hit the X before shoving the next video in my face, without even letting me choose which one.

What about OPTIONS? There is an option screen and it has about 4 settings to control downloads and that is it.  Is it too much to ask that the millions they pay their team to develop this app that maybe just maybe they could add settings to control its autoplay behavior?

For that matter, I also hate the main selection system.  Netflix has a massive catalog, but they only show you the things ""you want to see"", and they're wrong more often than right.  The only way to actually explore the full catalog is to know the name in advance and type it into the search.

Add in that they cancel things after the earlier season sets us up for the next that never comes, and I'm just not a happy customer right now.  (looking at Cowboy Bebop that didn't get season 2, grr)",2022-08-18 08:51:22,False,netflix,363590051

Walgreenphotoappisawasteoftime,an annoying feature.,3,"this goes for any and every device. 
i absolutely hate the ""Skip Intro"" button. its not being able to skip it thats annoying, its the automation. 
if youre confused, sometimes if you click ""Skip Intro"" on the first episode of any show it will automatically skip it for every other episode.
the problem with this is that for basically all of the shows on netflix, on the first episode there is NEVER the option to skip the intro.
so basically for the rest of show, you have to deal with clicking the ""Skip Intro"" button each and every time. for most people, this isnt a big deal. but for someone who is constantly busy and is doing other stuff while listening to a show, its super annoying.

Solution:
make an option to always skip intro. whether thats a pop up or in a settings, there should be an option to always skip the intro. and if youre wondering; ""well what if i wanted to watch it that time?"" then go back and watch it. then maybe for the rest of the show it doesnt skip the intro. simple as that.",2022-05-24 01:44:15,False,netflix,363590051

az_zoha,Heating issue + stuck after Netflix logo during app startup,2,"iPhone 12 Pro
Constantly plagued with heating issues where my phone would get uncharacteristically hot on the backside, beside the camera module. 

Clearing the app from memory and reloading helps with the heating issues but that introduces another. 

Sometimes when the app is cleared from memory, the app refuses to go past the Netflix logo animation where profiles can be selected. Just an infinite spinner animation after the Netflix logo animation and that’s it! No matter how many times I clear the app from memory this problem doesn’t go away until I have to RESTART MY DEVICE! 

According to a quick lookup on this issue on the internet, I have come across many others complaining about the same problem since mid 2021. And now, we’re halfway through 2022 and this is yet not fixed!

With dwindling original content, cracking down on password sharing and vpn services, the least you guys can do is give us a usable app with reliable performance. Otherwise, you’d lose more than just users.",2022-06-09 22:40:34,False,netflix,363590051

What’s the biggest issue with netflix and being in a pandemic? You can’t watch shows together. On Facetime (iPhone), it darkens the screen and zoom hardly works-

It’s hard to be in a pandemic and wanting to start and watch a movie or show with another party while on different accounts- you can’t sync them up properly most of the time, and other times, you can’t get it to show on screen. So why not add that option in?

aksdssd,Greedy companies deserve to fail,1,Netflix used to offer a good selection of shows for a reasonable price. More recently however they’ve lost most of the shows I used to love on the service. They’ve also been raising the price for their increasingly subpar selection of shows under the guise of investing in more quality content. Unfortunately there seems to be nothing to show for the increase in price. Beyond that they’re now disallowing account sharing across households and are planning on introducing ads to the service. Corporate greed has completely ruined Netflix and what used to be a great alternative to cable is no longer worth the subscription.

I do not doubt their are good homosexual and trans people in this world, but they would not go into the houses of children and try to force them into being homosexual or trans as Netflix does.

MarklRyu,So many issues,1,"There are several issues from not remembering what episode I was last on, to the unfortunate monkey brained decision to change the method of downloading shows to watch when there’s no wifi.

You used to just click on the download button next to the episode and it would download it, as well as anymore episodes you watch as you watch them. It worked Perfectly, zero issues, zero complaints, it was simple, and easy, a basic function.

Now there is a Downloads section you can go to; this section has No search bar, doesn’t display the shows you are Currently Watching, and is absolutely unnecessary. So I’m gonna go eat my lunch in a room without wifi, and with no show; because someone without a brain decided this was a brilliant idea, and that person can jump off a cliff. Thank you.

I do really like this app, but I think y’all should add a teen section and stop canceling shows. It’s really annoying when your favorite show gets canceled.

There’s baby’s and there’s adults sections basically, but no Teen stuff. Can’t you please, please add some teen stuff? 🙏 This load of bread does not enjoy having to switch apps to watch my fav show that’s as canceled or to watch someone more my age.

When you change it back immediately- it changes your bill cycle date (and cuts your billing date back by 10 days) therefore overcharging by 1/3 of the month. 

This last month I was never notified of a change and my bill cycle date changed again by 10 days with the same payment and subscription settings listed for July and August. My date moved from 7/27 to 8/17 for $9.99 a month for both.
